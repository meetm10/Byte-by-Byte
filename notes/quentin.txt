Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.
You always say that.
The same thing every time.
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.
The days of me remembering
have just begun.
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I mean, the way it is now,
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.
-No more liquor stores?
-What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.
You tell'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.
They make it too personal.
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.
And if it's not the gooks,
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.
You got Grandpa Irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?
- Not in this life.
- What then?
Garon, coffee!
This place.
Garon means boy.
This place?
A coffee shop?
What's wrong with that?
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.
Same as banks,
these places are insured.
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.
One minute, they're havin'
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?
Pretty smart.
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember?
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!
Any of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

- Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's illegal to carry it,
but-but that doesn't matter,
'cause get a load of this.
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, it's illegal
for them to search you.
- I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh, man! I'm goin'.
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?
- What?
It's the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here,
- but it's just there,
it's a little different.
- Example.
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
And in Paris, you can buy
a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.
What do they call a Big Mac?
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.
Le Big Mac.
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!
- I seen'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown'em in that shit.
- Yuck.
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.
- How many up there?
- Three or four.
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?
- It's possible.
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.
- What's her name?
- Mia.
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,
- and on this invention
they show shows, right?
- Yeah.
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.
Word 'round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallace's wife.
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.
A foot massage?
- That's it?
Then what'd Marsellus do?
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.
Nigger fell through that.
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.
- That's a damn shame.
- But still, you play
with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.
You don't think he overreacted?
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.
I mean, is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out? No, but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?
Shit, yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?
- Fuck you.
- You give'em a lot?
- Fuck you.
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.
What time you got?
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house,
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass,
'cause I kill the motherfucker.
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.
Now, look, I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin'.
We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's an interestin' point.
Come on.
Let's get into character.
- What's her name again?
- Mia.
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife?
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?
It is not a date.
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.
- It's just good company, that's all.
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?
Hey, keep chillin'.
You know who we are?
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,
don't ya, Brett?
Yeah, I remember.
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?
Hamburgers.
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.
What kind of hamburgers?
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?
They're... They're good.
You mind if I try
one of yours?
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.
But I do love the taste
of a good burger.
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?
Uh, because of
the metric system?
Check out the big brain
on Brett!
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.
- What's in this?
- Sprite.
Sprite. Good.
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?
Go right ahead.
That hit the spot.
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?
- Why don't you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over...
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!
You were sayin'?
It's in the cupboard.
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.
We happy?
Vincent?
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l...
I didn't get your name.
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.
- My name's Pitt, and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.
I just want you
to know how...
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...
with us and Mr. Wallace.
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never...
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!
Oh, well, allow me to retort.
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?
What?
- What country you from?
- What?
- "What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What?
- W-What?
- English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?
- Yes!
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!
- What? l...
- Say "what" again!
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.
- Go on!
- He's bald!
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?
Does he look... like a bitch?
- No!
- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch?
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.
Ezekiel 25:17.
"The path of the righteous man...
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...
and the tyranny of evil men.
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...
and the finder
of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...
and furious anger...
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!
And you will know
My name is the Lord...
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"
I think you gonna find...
when all this shit
is over and done...
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.
The thing is, Butch,
right now...
you got ability.
But painful as it may be,
ability... don't last.
And your days are just about over.
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.
Besides, Butch,
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?
Two?
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.
You came close,
but you never made it.
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.
You my nigger?
Certainly appears so.
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.
That's pride fuckin' with you.
Fuck pride!
Pride only hurts.
It never helps.
You fight through that shit.
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.
Say it.
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.
- Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.
Where's the big man?
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.
How ya been?
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?
- All right.
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.
At Marsellus's request.
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.
- What's so fuckin' funny?
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,
Laugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?
Asshole.
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?
No.
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.
-What was that?
-I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
Vincent Vega's in the house?
My nigger,
get your ass over here.
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.
You shouldn't worry about it.
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
And some matches.
Thanks.
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.
That gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce
your nipples, do they?
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.
I was just curious,
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
Now, the first two are the same.
But this one
is a little more expensive.
This is 500 a gram.
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.
Am I a nigger?
Are we in Inglewood? No.
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.
That is what a nice guy I am.
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?
Okay.
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?
-The one with all the shit in her face?
-No, that's Jody.
That's my wife.
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.
- I'll take a rain check.
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.
Still got your Malibu?
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.
I had it in storage
for three years.
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
They should be fuckin' killed,
man. No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.
I wish I could've caught him
doin' it. I'd have given
anything to catch that asshole.
- It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker!
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.
Muchas gracias.
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.
Hello?
Billy Raye was a preacher's son
and when his daddy would visit
he'd come along
Vincent.
Vincent.
I'm on the intercom.
Where is...
Where is the intercom?
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.
To your right.
Warm.
Warmer.
Disco.
Hello?
Push the button
if you want to talk.
Hello?
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
The bar's by the fireplace.
Okay.
When he started
sweet talkin' to me
He come and tell me
everything is all right
He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right
Can I get away
again tonight
The only one who could
ever reach me
Was the son
of a preacher man
The only boy
who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was
He was
- Lord he knows he was
- Yes he was
How will I remember
The look was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me
on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that
he's all mine
- Learning from each other's knowin'
Looking to see
how much we've grown
And the only one
who could ever reach me
Was the son
of a preacher man
The only boy
who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was
- Was, was
- He was
- Oh, yes he was
Let's go.
What the fuck is this place?

- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

Just to let you

in the second half of our show,
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.
Thank you.
Call for...
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell, and...
Oh, yeah, look at this...
vanilla Coke.
What about you, Peggy Sue?
I'll have the...
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
And... a five-dollar shake.
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order
a five-dollar shake?
Mm-hmm.
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?
- No.
- Just checking.
I'll be right back
with your drinks.
To Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles away
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?
You can have this one, cowgirl.
- Thanks.
The streets are filled
with regret
Think nothin' of it.
Lay me down
in Lonesome Town
- I can learn to forget
- So...
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?
Just over three years.
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.
Why would you?
I heard you did a pilot.
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.
- What?
- Fox Force Five.
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.
The black girl
was a demolition expert.
French fox's speciality was sex.
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.
According to the show,
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...
where every show
I would've told another joke.
You know any of them old jokes?
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.
- Tell me.
- It's corny.
Don't be that way.
Tell me.
- No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr...
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
That's not what I meant.
You know it.
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.
What a gyp.
Martin and Lewis.
Vanilla Coke.
You think I could
have a sip of that?
Be my guest.
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.
- You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
Cooties I can handle.
All right.
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!
-Told ya.
-I don't know if it was worth $5,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?
Uncomfortable silences.
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.
Well, I don't think we're quite
there yet, but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.
You sit here...
and think of something to say.
I'll do that.
Okay.
I said goddamn!
Goddamn!
Goddamn.
I need some hair spray.
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you?
We're lucky
we got anything at all.
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.
That is Mamie Van Doren.
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.
However...
you seem like
a really nice person, and l...
- I don't want to offend you.
This doesn't sound like
the usual, mindless, boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.
Well, well, I do. I do.
- But you have
to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me, and my natural response
could be to get offended.
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,
- isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?
- All right, all right.
Well, here goes.
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.
Yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.
- Is that a fact?
- No.
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.
- Who told you?
- They.
"They" talk a lot, don't they?
They certainly do.
They certainly do.
- Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say?
- I'm... I'm not shy.
- Um...
- Did it involve the "F" word?
No, no, no, no, no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.
- And?
- And... And nothin'.
That's it.
You heard Marsellus...
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage?
- And you believe that?
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.
But did it happen?
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it... at my wedding.
Really?
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...
except Marsellus and Tony.
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.
Now, who will be
our first contestants?
- Right here!
- All right!
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?
Mrs. Mia Wallace.
And how 'bout your fella here?
Vincent Vega.
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!
- Go for it.
- Come on!
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?
I don't know
what you call that.
- Drinks! Music!
I'm gonna take a piss.
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.
Girl
Bomp, bomp, bom
You'll be a woman soon
I love you so much
Can't count all the ways
I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is
He's not your kind
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them
make up your mind
Don't you know, girl
You'll be a woman soon
One drink, and that's it.
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.
Say good night...
and go home.
You'll be a woman soon
Soon
You'll be a woman
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life
But what they're sayin', girl
it cuts like a knife
The boy's no good
Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for
But if they get a chance
they'll end it for sure
Sure they would
Baby, I've done
all I could
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.
Because... being loyal
is very important.
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them
make up your mind
Don't you know, girl
You'll be a woman soon
Please
Come take my hand
Girl
You'll be a woman soon
Please
Come take my hand
- Hello.
- Girl
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening."
Walk out the door, get in
the car, go home, jerk off,
and that's all you gonna do.
Now it's up to you, girl
You'll be a woman soon
- Please
Come take my hand
- Girl
- You'll be a woman soon
Soon
You'll be a woman
All right, Mia.
So listen, I gotta go,
all right?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
You fu...
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me!
Oh... Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!
Fuck!
Answer.
- Have you got the ring?
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.
- Please! Please!
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!
Now what do you say?
I give up!
I'll marry you!
- Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!
I can hear it.
I thought you told those
fuckin' assholes never to
call here this late!
Yeah, I told them.
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.
-
Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.
Lance! Vincent.
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?
- I got this chick,
she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!
I'm not even joking with you!
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
- No choice.
- Wh... She's O.D.in'?
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.
Okay, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet, take her
to a hospital and call a lawyer.
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!
- What the hell was that?
Have you lost
your fucking mind?
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance, help me.
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help and
let her die on your lawn.
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.
- Shit.
Lance!
Shit.
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
What the fuck's going on out here?
Who's she?
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.
Just keep talking to her,
all right?
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!
I don't go joy-poppin'
with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!
- Get the shot!
- All right!
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!
What's he looking for?
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.
- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!
- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking, that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!
- Lance, get in here!
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.
- Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.
- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.
- You got it?
- What?
A magic marker.
A felt pen!
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.
- I never done this either!
I ain't starting now!
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.
Give it to me.
Give me that.
All right, tell me what to do.
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.
- But she's got a breastplate...
You gotta pierce through that.
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.
- I gotta... I gotta
stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?
- She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's...
- All right, count to three.
- All right. Ready?
- One.
Two.
Three!
If you're all right,
then say something.
Something.
That was fuckin' trippy.
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.
Mia. Mia.
What's...
What's your thoughts on... on...
on how to handle this?
What's yours?
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.
I seriously doubt that.
I can keep a secret if you can.
Shake on it?
Mum's the word?
Cool.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.
Vincent.
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?
Sure.
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.
- I can't wait.
- Okay.
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
Goes back and squishes him
and says,
"Ketchup."
Ketchup.
See you around.
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.
He think totem pole alive!
He arctic tenderfoot!
That totem pole been here forever!
- Butch?
One more thing, and we'll start for...
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?
Well, this here is Captain Koons.
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.
Hello, little man.
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...
over five years.
Hopefully...
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...
for as long as we were,
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.
If it'd been me who'd...
not made it,
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.
Butch...
I got something for ya.
This watch I got here...
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
on the day he set sail for Paris.
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.
This time they called it
World War ll.
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.
Your granddad was facing death.
He knew it.
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki...
a man he'd never met before
in his life...
to deliver to his infant son,
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.
This watch.
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something... his ass.
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.
Then he died of dysentery...
He give me the watch.
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.
Then...
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...
now...
Iittle man,
I give the watch to you.
It's time, Butch.
In the heavyweight division,
- in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks,
weighing 210 pounds,
Floyd Ray Wilson!
It's official. It's official.
- Wilson is dead!
- Well, Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest,
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.
Coolidge was out of there
faster than I've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.
I could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing.
- I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?
A tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations.
It's of paramount importance,
during the sad weeks ahead,
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain...
Man, you know I didn't...
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
- How you doing?
- Great.
I never thanked you
for dinner.
- What you got?
- He booked.
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.
- I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think."
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.
Butch's search...
How do you want it done?
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...
ready to pop a cap in his ass.
I will take care of it.
Mister.
- Hey, mister.
- What?
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
No, come on.
You're him.
I know you're him.
Tell me you're him.
I'm him.
You killed the other boxing man.
He's dead?
The radio said he was dead.
Sorry about that, Floyd.
What does it feel like?
What does what feel like?
Killing a man.
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.
What are you, a weirdo?
No.
It is a subject
I have much interest in.
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.
So?
- What does it feel like to kill a man?
I'll tell you what.
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there, and I'll
tell you all about it.
So, Esmeralda...
Villa Lobos...
Is that Mexican?
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.
- That's some handle
you got there, honey.
- Thank you.
And what is your name?
Butch.
Butch.
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.
So, moving right along,
Esmeralda,
what is it you want to know?
- I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man, the odds
went through the roof.
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
If he never
laced up his gloves,
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?
All eight?
How long to collect?
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No, I understand.
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
That is great news, man.
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
Okay, my brother.
You're right.
You're goddamn right.
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.
Cool, brother.
$45.60.
And, uh,
here's a little something
for the effort.
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?
The truth.
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.
Bonsoir,
Esmeralda Villa Lobos.
Buenas Noches, Butch.
Whew.
Keep the light off.
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.
Hard day at the office?
Pretty hard.
Got in a fight.
Poor baby.
Can you make spoons?
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.
Let me take this jacket off.
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.
I wish I had a pot.
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror,
and you wish you had some pot?
A pot.
A pot belly.
Pot bellies are sexy.
Well, you should be happy,
'cause you have one.
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."
It's not the same thing.
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.
The difference is huge.
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
No.
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.
The rest of you is normal... normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...
to accentuate it.
You think men
would find that attractive?
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
is seldom the same.
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.
Ohh! I'd smother you!
- I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.
- Promise?
- Yeah.
Did you get everything?
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.
Did everything
go as planned?
- You didn't listen to the... Ow!
You didn't listen to the radio?
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?
I won, all right.
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.
So it all worked out
in the finish.
We're not at the finish yet, baby.
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?
But they won't find us,
will they?
Do you still want me
to go with you?
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's...
Say it.
- Fabienne,
I want you to be with me.
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.
Do you love me?
Very, very much.
- Butch.
- Yes?
Will you give me
oral pleasure?
Will you kiss it?
But you first.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Butch.
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.
I think I cracked a rib.
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi...
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- I take it back.
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?
- Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.
And I took it back.
- Butch?
Yes, Lemon Pie?
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.
Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.
- If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
But I do not speak Spanish.
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.
Besides, Mexican's easy.
- Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?
Where is the shoe store?
- Donde esta...
- Spit, please.
- Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.
- Que hora es?
- Que hora es?
- What time is it?
- What time is it?
Time for bed.
Sweet dreams, jellybean.
Butch?
Never mind.
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.
- What was it about?
- How should I know?
You were the one watching it.
- No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?
- I don't know.
I don't remember.
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.
- Satisfied?
- Yep.
- Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!
- Ohh. God.
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?
- What, Lemon Pie?
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...
with maple syrup,
eggs over easy
and five sausages.
Anything to drink with that?
Wow, that looks nice.
To drink... A tall glass
of orange juice...
and a black cup of coffee.
- After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?
- Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.
Where's my watch?
It's there.
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
You sure you got it?
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
Yeah, well,
it's not here now.
- Well, it should be.
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now!
So where the fuck is it?
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.
All this other shit you could've set
on fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.
Now think.
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.
"You believe so"?
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.
Then I did.
Are you sure?
No.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'...
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?
No!
It's not your fault.
You left it at the apartment.
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.
I reminded you about it,
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.
You're not a mind reader.
Are you?
I... I'm sorry.
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.
Why does it mean that?
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,
then I'll split.
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.
Have a nice breakfast.
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."
Blueberry pie.
Maybe not that fast.
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,
she forgets my father's watch!
I specifically reminded her...
bedside table, on the kangaroo.
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's
nearest you...
i EI burro!
Lookin' good, Butch.
lf I were walkin'
in your shoes
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one
That's how you're gonna
beat 'em, Butch.
- Smokin' cigarettes and
watchin' Captain Kangaroo
- They keep underestimatin' ya.
Now don't tell me
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do
It's good to see you
I must go
I know I look a fright
- Anyway my eyes
- Motherfucker.
- Are not accustomed...
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.
If you need someone to go
to court, I'll be glad to help.
That guy was a drunken maniac.
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.
- Who?
- Him.
I'll be damned.
- Aaaah! I'm shot!
- Sally! Sally!
Motherfucker!
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.
Now you just wait
a goddamn minute, now!
What the fuck you up to?
- Come here, motherfucker!
- You feel that sting, huh, big boy?
That's pride
fuckin' with you, see?
You gotta fight through that shit!
- You'd better kill me...
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to...
- Hold it right there, goddamn it.
- This ain't none
of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.
Toss the weapon.
It's time
- To find love
- Take your foot off the nigger,
- put your hand behind your head,
approach the counter right now.
- This motherfucker's trying to...
kill me.
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.
lf love
Is shelter
Zed. Maynard.
Yeah, the spider
just caught a couple flies.
Whoa, my angel
Down to you
Down to you
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business...
- except me or Zed.
That's Zed.
- I thought
you said you waited for me.
- I did.
Then how come they're all beat up?
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.
Is that right?
You gonna shoot him, boy?
Huh?
Hey, is Grace
all right out front?
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.
Well, bring out the Gimp.
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?
Get up.
Get down.
Which one of'em
you wanna do first?
- I ain't for sure yet.
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,
catch a nigger...
by his toe.
If he hollers, let him go.
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.
My mother said...
pick the perfect one,
and... you... are...
it.
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!
- You wanna do it in here?
- No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.
Sounds good to me.
You keep an eye on this 'un.
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!
- Now, motherfucker!
Aaah!
- Come on! Yeah!
- Ohh!
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!
Yeee!
Yeeee-hah!
Yeah!
Come on!
Get down there!
Aaah!
Do it! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
- Shut the fuck up!
Fuck him!
Come on!
- Fuck him. Yeah.
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed?
Go ahead and pick it up.
Go ahead. Pick it up.
Come on...
Thatta boy!
I want you to pick it up, Zed.
- Step aside, Butch.
Fuck!
- You okay?
No, man.
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.
- What now?
"What now"?
- Let me tell you what now.
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...
to go to work
on the homes here...
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.
I meant what now
between me and you.
Oh, that "what now."
- I tell you what now
between me and you.
There is no me and you.
Not no more.
So, are we cool?
Yeah, we cool.
- Two things.
Don't tell nobody about this.
This shit is between me, you...
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...
rapist here.
It ain't nobody else's business.
Two:
You leave town tonight.
Right now.
And when you gone,
you stay gone,
- or you be gone.
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?
Deal.
Get your ass outta here.
Oh, shit.
Fabienne!
Fabienne!
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?
Come on, honey!
Where did you get
this motorcycle?
- It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?
I'm sorry, baby,
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we...
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started
to think dreadful thoughts.
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,
the single weirdest
fuckin' day of my life...
I'll tell you all about it.
Gotta go. Come on.
Butch, whose motorcycle
is this?
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.
Yes, you did, Brett!
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace
don't liked to be fucked...
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.
Sorta fits the occasion.
Ezekiel 25:17.
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...
by the inequities
of the selfish...
- and the tyranny of evil men.
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...
and the finder
of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...
and furious anger...
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.
And you will know
My name is the Lord...
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
- Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
- Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...
with a goddamn hand cannon?
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.
We should be fuckin' dead, man.
I know.
We was lucky.
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.
You know what
divine intervention is?
I think so.
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
- What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...
or in a jailhouse
with the cops?
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.
You ever seen that show Cops?
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,
and he was talkin' about this
gunfight he had in the hallway
with this guy, right?
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin'
freakin' out on us?
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today...
I'm through.
- Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.
- And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.
Marvin, what do you make of all this?
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped...
- What the fuck's happenin'?
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this...
- Chill out, man!
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!
We gotta get this car off
the road. Cops notice shit
like a car drenched in blood.
- Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.
- Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
-Where's Toluca Lake?
-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch... Jimmie's a friend.
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.
Just tell him
not to be abusive.
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.
Put yourself in his position...
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.
He wasn't expectin' this shit.
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.
If that favor means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin' my hands!
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.
- I watched you get'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position, all right?
All right.
Fine. Fine.
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!
This some serious
gourmet shit.
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.
Right?
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But you know what's on
my mind right now? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.
- Jimmie, don't even worry...
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.
When you came pulling in here,
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?
- You know I ain't seen no...
- Did you notice the sign on
the front of my house...
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?
No. I didn't.
- You know why you didn't
see that sign?
- Why?
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker...
- Don't you fuckin' realize...
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced?
No marriage counselor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there?
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.
You're fucking my shit up
right now!
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.
Do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.
Well, say she comes home.
What do you think she'll do?
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
That ain't no kinda answer.
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...
this Bonnie situation is.
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen...
doing a bunch of gangster shit,
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!
All I want to hear from your ass
is, "You ain't got no problem,
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.
Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."
You ain't got no problem, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker.
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.
You sendin' the Wolf?
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?
Shit, yeah, negro!
That's all you had to say!
- She the hysterical type?
- When is she due?
Give me
the principals' names again.
Place your bets.
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.
Vincent.
Jimmie.
Bonnie.
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?
Uh, yeah. Please do.
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
Uh, one hundred percent.
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
- Uh-huh.
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.
- Jimmie.
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.
Let's go back
to the kitchen.
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.
Okay, first thing.
You two.
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...
and clean the inside of the car...
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.
We need to raid
your linen closet.
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...
with quilts and blankets,
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.
"Please" would be nice.
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
Green.
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.
About 20 minutes.
Nobody who'll be missed.
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.
- I got it all here, but, uh,
- Mr. Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.
Uh... Uh, no,
thank you.
Uh, this is
our best linen here,
and it's, uh...
it was a wedding present...
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help...
- Let me ask you a question.
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?
No.
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.
How about you, Jimmie?
You an oak man?
Oak's nice.
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
That's all.
I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!
Fine job, gentlemen.
You may get out of this yet.
I can't believe
this is the same car.
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.
Phase one is complete... Clean the car...
which moves us right along to Phase two:
Clean you two.
Strip.
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?
- You know what you two look like?
- What?
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.
Toss'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!
Better you than me, gentlemen.
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
Towel.
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.
Perfect.
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.
You guys look like...
What do they look like,
Jimmie?
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.
Don't make me beg.
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood,
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.
Spoken like a true prodigy.
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.
Outta my way, Rex.
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.
Someday all this will be hers.
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?
- You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.
It's...
It's your future. I...
I see a...
a cab ride.
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
Call me Winston.
- You see that, young lady? Respect.
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.
- Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.
- Wanna share a cab?
- I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
Cool.
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
- Want some bacon?
No, man, I don't eat pork.
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,
but they're definitely dirty.
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.
Oh, man, that's good.
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.
But this morning...
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi,
found my car keys.
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.
God got involved.
But why?
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?
- If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.
And without a job,
a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.
Garon! Coffee!
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.
- But water into wine, l...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
- Don't fuckin' talk
to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,
then you should cease
asking scary questions.
I'm gonna take a shit.
Let me ask you something.
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin?
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,
replayin' the incident
in my head,
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.
Fuck. To be continued.
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.
- Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!
- You got that?
You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!
Get on the fuckin'...
Get the fuck down!
You're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth,
on the count of ten!
- Mexicans, out of
the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!
- Fucking move! Move!
- Move! Get the fuck...
Get down on the fucking floor!
Grandpa! Down!
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!
- I think we got
a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!
- I am not a hero.
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!
The restaurant's ours!
- Just take whatever you want.
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.
- You understand me?
- Yes!
Listen, everybody.
Be calm, cooperate,
and this'll all be over
in a minute!
Get the fuck down!
Well done.
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?
I said, are we fucking clear?
Good!
Now, wallets out!
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't
have nothin' on me, man.
In the bag.
What am I waiting for?
ln the fucking bag.
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.
In the fucking bag.
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.
In the bag.
In the bag.
In the bag.
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.
What's going on?
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed! Give'em
what you got and get'em outta here!
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.
No problem.
I got it under control.
Now, I'm gonna count to three.
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
We clear?
One.
Two.
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.
You win.
It's yours.
- Open it.
Hey, what is it?
What is it?
Is that what I think it is?
It's beautiful.
Goddamn it, what is it?
You let him go!
You let him go!
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool! Be cool!
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.
- What?
- Cool.
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.
And when I count three,
I want you to
let go of your gun,
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.
And when you do it,
you do it cool.
You ready?
One,
two,
three.
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.
When I get nervous,
I get scared.
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.
Just know, you hurt him, you die.
Well, that seems to be
the situation.
But I don't want that.
And you don't want that.
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
Now... here's the situation.
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.
- Vincent!
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...
and don't do
a goddamn thing.
Tell her it's still cool.
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?
I... I gotta go pee.
I wanna go home.
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.
Open it up.
Take out the money.
Count it.
How much is there?
About 1,500 dollars.
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
Vince, shut the fuck up!
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.
I'm buyin' something
for my money.
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.
You read the Bible, Ringo?
Not regularly, no.
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17.
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...
by the inequities
of the selfish...
and the tyranny of evil men.
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.
And you will know
I am the Lord...
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."
I been sayin' that shit for years,
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...
before I popped a cap
in his ass.
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.
Or it could mean...
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.
Now, I'd like that.
But that shit
ain't the truth.
The truth is,
you're the weak...
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.
But I'm tryin', Ringo.
I'm tryin' real hard...
to be the shepherd.
Go.
I think we should be
leaving now.
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.
No, it ain't.
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.
Personally, I can do without her.
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.
I was sayin' something.
What was it?
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.
- What was her last name?
- What's that?
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.
Chew? Toby Chew?
It hurts. It hurts her.
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.
It hurts just like it did
the first time.
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...
what it was once like
to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like A Virgin."
Wong.
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.
"Toby. Toby?
Toby? Toby Wong.
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.
Give me that book.
Are you gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?
Shit.
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.
But this is the first time
I ever realized...
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
I must've zoned out
during that part before.
All right,
I'll take care of the check.
All right,
I'll take care of the check.
You guys can get the tip.
Should be about a buck apiece.
And you, when I come back
I want my book.
Sorry. It's my book now.
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.
Come on, throw in a buck.
I don't tip.
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?
I don't tip because
society says I have to.
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?
I'd go over 12% for that.
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.
I want it filled six times.
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...
another cup of coffee.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?
You know what this is?
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.
They're servin' you food,
but society says...
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...
for female non-college graduates
in this country.
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.
The reason is
because of their tips.
Fuck all that.
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.
Hey. Leave the dollars there.
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?
- Why not?
- He don't tip.
He don't tip?
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.
Never mind what you
normally would do.
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...
just keeps on truckin'.
just keeps on truckin'.
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die!
Just hold on, buddy boy!
I'm gonna die!
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!
I'm gonna die!
I know it!
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.
Are you a doctor?
Are you a doctor?
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?
No, I'm not.
I'm not.
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...
you're gonna be okay.
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!
Say it!
You're gonna be okay!
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!
Oh, God!
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!
Say it!
Okay, Larry.
Correct! Correct!
I'm okay.
Look where we are.
Look where we are.
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!
We're in a warehouse.
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?
Come on, who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.
You're a fuckin' tough guy.
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.
We made it. We made it.
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.
Look where we are.
Hold on. Hold on.
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?
I can't do anything for you.
But when Joe gets here...
which should be any time now...
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.
Would you please hold me?
Yeah, sure.
You go ahead and be scared.
You've been brave enough
for one day.
I just want you
to relax now, okay?
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.
It's not good, no.
Hey, Larry...
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.
I was panicking
for a minute back there.
But I got my senses back now.
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.
I swear to fucking God, man.
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.
I won't tell them anything.
You'll be safe, man.
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.
Along with the kneecap...
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.
No shit!
But it takes a long time
to die from it.
I'm talkin' days.
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.
Time is on your side.
Was that a fucking setup, or what?
Shit. Orange got tagged?
Gut shot.
Fuck. Where's Brown?
Dead.
How did he die?
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.
This is bad.
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?
As opposed to good?
Man, this is fucked up.
This is so fucked up.
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.
Larry, don't leave me.
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?
I'm right over there.
Larry...
I'm gonna fucking die.
Larry.
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?
I felt funny about
this job right off.
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!
What's done is done.
I need you cool.
Are you cool?
I'm cool.
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.
Relax. Have a cigarette.
I quit.
- All right.
- Why, you got one?
Okay, let's go through
what happened.
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.
Then the alarm gets tripped.
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.
You're right.
This is bad.
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!
Move it!
Get outta the way!
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!
Move!
Jesus!
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!
Move it!
Move outta the way!
I tagged a couple of cops.
Did you kill anybody?
- A few cops.
- No real people?
Just cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?
I don't want to kill anybody.
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it.
The choice between
doin' ten years...
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...
ain't no choice at all.
But I ain't no madman, either.
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.
Things get tense.
It's human nature.
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?
- Maybe 21?
- If that.
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.
After that,
I don't know what went down.
It was every man for himself.
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.
What do you think?
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
That's my boy.
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.
That was the plan.
We meet here.
Then where the fuck is everybody?
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.
What?
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.
No shit?
Thank God we discovered in time.
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.
So who's the rat this time?
Mr. Blue?
Mr. Brown?
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.
For all I know, you're the rat.
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.
For all we know, he's the rat.
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...
so don't you be calling him a rat!
Look, I'm right, okay?
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...
and make a right.
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.
But I thought you two
were a team.
We were for a little while.
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.
Why?
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.
What's she doin' now?
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?
Bad luck.
I guess you can say that again.
What's the exposure like?
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.
Security pretty lax.
They most usually
just deal in boxes.
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.
They're like a way station,
you know?
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.
What's the cut, poppa?
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.
Look, man, you do what you want.
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?
Huh? ls he dead or what?
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?
I think he's just passed out.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.
You got an idea, spit it out.
Joe could help.
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.
He begged me to do it.
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.
If that's what he said,
let's do it.
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.
He knows a little about me.
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?
I told him my first name
and where I was from.
Why?
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.
It was just
a natural conversation.
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?
He asked.
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.
It was my fault he got shot.
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.
He's screamin'.
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.
And he asked me
what my name was.
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?
It's against the rules?
I don't trust you enough?
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.
If we don't, he's gonna die.
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...
and that can't happen!
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!
I didn't tell him
where I was from!
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!
You kids shouldn't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.
Mr. Blonde.
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.
Hey, you okay?
Did you see what happened to Blue?
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.
Enough! Enough!
You better start talkin', asshole.
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.
We're already freaked out.
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
Okay, let's talk.
We think we got
a rat in the house.
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.
What makes you say that?
Is that supposed to be funny?
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.
Nobody's goin' anywhere.
Piss on this fuckin' turd.
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.
Fuck you, maniac!
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!
What's this guy's problem?
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!
I got a big fuckin' problem...
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!
In the store! Remember?
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.
You almost killed me!
Asshole!
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...
or are you gonna bite?
What was that?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...
or are you gonna bite?
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?
Wow.
That was really exciting.
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.
Follow you? Where?
To my car.
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.
- What?
- It's a big surprise.
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.
So in the meantime...
I'll show you guys somethin'.
Jesus Christ.
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.
You're a piece of work,
my friend.
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.
Hey, Sid, will you relax?
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.
I know you'll pay me back.
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.
- Who?
- Vic Vega.
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.
Hey, welcome home, Vic.
How does freedom feel, huh?
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.
How about a little Remy Martin?
Sure.
Who's your parole officer?
Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
He's a fuckin' asshole.
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.
It never ceases to amaze me.
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.
What the hell
was I supposed to do?
Forget about you?
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.
Thanks a lot, Joe.
Ah, Vic.
Toothpick Vic.
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.
That I should've picked you up?
No, that you had
your head up your ass.
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.
He's ruining the business.
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.
That's very true.
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!
Come on, this ain't a playground!
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.
I don't think of you that way.
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...
and it's comin' out your mouth!
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!
Now both of you, sit down.
Now, Eddie...
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.
Vic here's got a parole problem.
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.
Scagnetti. Fuck.
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?
Well, I wanna.
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...
before I can move out on my own.
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...
every fuckin' night.
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?
This ain't all that bad.
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.
You just missed him.
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.
We got places all over the place.
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...
you know, do some real work.
Well, it's hard to say.
It's kind of a strange time now.
Things are kind of--
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.
Get you a job,
give you some cash...
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?
Huh?
Dad, I got an idea.
Just hear me out.
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.
I'd like to have him in.
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.
All right, Vic...
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?
I'd feel great about it.
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.
If you're the 12th caller...
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.
Get up! Get up!
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!
I don't know who did what!
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.
I will know.
I'm practically there now.
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?
All right.
You sure that's what he said?
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.
Huh? Fuck you!
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?
Holy shit. Orange is dead.
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.
The cops were there
waitin' for us.
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?
I don't know, but somebody did.
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?
Where's Joseph?
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.
What'd Joe say?
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.
You ain't dying. He is.
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!
Who?
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.
Brown's dead? Are you sure?
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?
Either he's alive or he's dead...
or the cops got him
or they don't.
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.
Why are you beatin' on him?
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!
Come on, man, think!
All right,
first things fuckin' last.
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.
I got a bag.
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.
Okay.
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.
White and Pink,
take a car each.
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.
You can't leave these guys
here with him.
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?
Tell him!
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...
bam, bam.
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.
My fuckin' hero.
Thanks.
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.
I haven't been looking at you guys.
Shut the fuck up, man!
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!
Now here's the news!
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.
Fine. Let's go.
Alone at last.
Guess what.
I think I'm parked in the red zone.
Now, where were we?
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.
I've been on the force
for only eight months.
They don't tell me anything.
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.
Torture you?
That's a good--
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.
- My what?
- Your boss.
Excuse me, pal.
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.
Get that fuckin' shit off.
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...
regardless.
Not to get information.
It's amusing to me...
to torture a cop.
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.
All you can do is...
pray for a quick death...
which...
you ain't gonna get.
Oh, God.
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?
It's my personal favorite.
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...
from April of 1974.
That reached up to number five...
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.
Hold still.
Hold still, you fuck.
Was that good for you too?
Hey, what's goin' on?
You hear that?
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Don't! Stop! Stop!
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.
That burn a little bit?
Don't! Stop!
Please stop.
Just stop. Stop.
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.
Don't burn me, please.
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.
I'm not gonna say anything.
No! Please, no.
- You all through?
- Stop!
You all through?
Please.
I got a little kid at home.
You all done?
- Don't!
- Have some fire.
Oh, shit.
Hey, you.
What's your name?
Marvin.
Marvin what?
Marvin Nash.
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.
Yeah, I know.
You do?
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.
Newendyke.
Freddy Newendyke.
Frankie Ferchetti...
introduced us
about five months ago.
I don't remember that at all.
I do.
Freddy.
How do I look?
What?
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.
That fuck.
That sick fuck!
That fuckin' bastard!
Marvin, I need you to hold on.
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.
What the fuck
are they waiting for?
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!
I'm fuckin' deformed!
Fuck you!
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!
I'm fuckin' dyin'!
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.
I was sent in to get him.
All right?
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.
This better not be a joke.
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.
We get there...
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.
Okay, Mr. Orange.
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?
Yes. Mr. White.
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?
Mr. White.
- A little.
- About what?
The Brewers.
Milwaukee Brewers?
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.
And I'll bet you everything...
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...
and that I was ready to move.
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.
He's selling out his friends.
That's how nice he fuckin' is.
I'll take care of his ass...
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.
Gone.
Use the commode story?
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.
What is this?
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.
Think about it like it's a joke.
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.
You can tell a joke,
can't you?
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...
and tell a joke, all right?
The things you gotta remember
are the details.
The details sell your story.
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.
You gotta know
all the details--
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...
they used in high school.
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...
and how you perceived
the events that went down.
The only way to do that...
is keep sayin' it...
and sayin' it and sayin' it.
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...
and all my friends knew it.
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"
I say, "Hey, dude.
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.
It got to be--
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.
She didn't even have to
meet these people.
I was doing all the work.
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.
When I get some,
I'll call you."
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.
They're my friends and everything,
but still--
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.
This was a very weird situation.
Remember back in '86...
there was a major
fuckin' drought.
Nobody had anything.
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--
ten percent
and free pot for me...
if I helped her
that weekend.
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.
What for?
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.
She keeps asking me, asking me.
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?
The guy needed it right away.
Anyway, we get to
the train station...
and we're waitin' for the guy.
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...
and they looked at me.
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.
German shepherd starts barking.
He's barkin' at me.
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.
Bam! Right in the face.
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.
They can smell it on me.
Shut up.
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...
"I know, I know."
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!
Put your hands on the dash."
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.
"I know, buddy, I know."
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.
And I said...
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...
if you don't put your hands up."
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.
What was he goin' for?
His fucking registration.
- You're kidding.
- No, man!
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.
That close, man.
You knew how to handle
that situation.
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.
Tell me more about Cabot.
I don't know.
He's a cool guy.
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.
You remember
the Fantastic Four?
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?
Thing.
Motherfucker...
Iooks just like the Thing.
Hey! Showtime!
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.
I'll be right down.
He'll be right down.
Don't pussy out on me now.
They don't know.
They don't know shit.
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.
There goes our boy.
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...
to work undercover.
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.
I know what I'm talking about.
Black women ain't the same
as white women.
There's a slight difference.
Very funny.
You know what I mean.
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.
Tell you guys a story.
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.
Where was she from?
Compton?
She's from Ladora Heights.
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.
It's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway...
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...
about the black female cop?
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.
Pam Grier did the film.
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.
Anne Francis.
No. That was Honey West.
Anne Francis is white.
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.
We come into the club
one night...
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"
Apparently Lady E...
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.
He used to do things to her.
Like what?
What would he do?
Beat her up?
I don't know.
He just did things.
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.
She waits for him to get drunk.
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...
and glues his dick
to his belly.
Jesus Christ!
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.
Was he all pissed off?
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.
Well, let me tell a joke.
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...
San Quentin...
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?
It's your fault, his fault--"
All that bullshit.
Finally somebody says...
"Wait a minute.
While we were
planning this caper...
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."
Got the message?
I don't mean to holler at ya.
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.
Find me a different character
down there.
Right now it's a matter
of business.
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...
who you already know...
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.
Under no circumstances...
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...
by your Christian names.
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...
where you might've done time...
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...
is what you're gonna do.
That should do it.
These are your names--
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.
How about Mr. Purple?
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.
You're not Mr. Purple.
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!
Who cares what your name is?
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.
There's two ways you can go
on this job--
my way or the highway.
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.
I'll move on
when I feel like it.
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.
Let's go to work.
Let's go over it.
Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.
We're there
for those stones, period.
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?
A store like this
is insured up the ass.
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...
smash their nose with your gun.
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.
If it's the manager,
that's different.
The managers know not
to fuck around...
so if he's giving you static...
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.
Fuck.
Jesus.
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.
Is he dead?
Did he die or not?
Let's go.
Hold it! Get out!
Get out of the fuckin' car!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.
I can't believe she killed me.
Who'd have fucking thought that?
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.
But you ain't dying.
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.
I'm gonna die.
I know it.
What the fuck happened?
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
What? I didn't hear you.
I said...
Blonde went crazy.
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
This cop?
He went crazy?
Something like that?
Worse or better?
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.
What'd I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...
was gonna kill you...
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...
take the diamonds and scram.
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?
I swear on my mother's soul...
that's what happened.
The man you killed
just got released from prison.
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.
He could've fuckin' walked.
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.
He did four years for us.
So, Mr. Orange...
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...
who did four years
for my father...
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...
you're telling me that
now that he's free...
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...
to rip us off?
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.
What the hell for?
It'd just be more bullshit.
This man set us up.
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...
what you're talking about.
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.
Like hell I am.
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.
He's a good kid.
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.
We're all real emotional.
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.
You don't know jack shit!
I do.
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.
How do you know all this?
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.
I ignored it before,
but no more.
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.
Larry, look...
it's been quite a long time.
A lot of jobs.
There's no need for this, man.
Let's just put our guns down...
and let's settle this...
with a fucking conversation.
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.
Larry, we have been friends.
You respect my dad
and I respect you...
but I'll put bullets
in you.
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.
Goddamn you, Joe...
don't make me do this.
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!
I'm sorry, kid.
Looks like we're gonna...
do a little time.
I'm a cop.
Larry...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
so sorry.
I'm a cop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm...
sorr--
Freeze!
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!
- Now!
- Put the gun down!
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!

[DISTANT RUMBLING]
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
[MEN SPEAKING GERMAN]
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware
of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me
what you've heard.
I've heard
that the Fhrer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.
The Fhrer couldn't have
said it better himself.
But the meaning
of your visit,
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews
and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports
of this area.
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me
with answers,
my department can close
the file on your family.
Now,
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,
all dairy farmers
like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins,
the Loveitts
and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge,
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb
you if I smoked my pipe?
[CHUCKLES] Please,
monsieur LaPadite,
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.
Now, according
to these papers,
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for
except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be
so misleading,
where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite,
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?
[CLEARS THROAT]
Again,
this is just a rumor,
but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.
[MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING]
So, the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?
[AGREES IN FRENCH]
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me
the exact members of the
household and their names?
[CLEARS THROAT]
There were
five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos
and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
[SIGHS]
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess
that should do it.
[ZIPPER CLOSING]
However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite,
are you aware of the nickname the
people of France have given me?
[SIGHS]
I have no interest
in such things.
But you are aware
of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
[THANKING IN FRENCH]
That they call you
"The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title
precisely because
I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,
as opposed to most
German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew
where they can only
think like a German.
[CHUCKLING] More precisely,
a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,
it would be
that of the rat.
The Fhrer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions
differ,
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world,
indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,
would you greet it
with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done
anything to you
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,
a squirrel could
equally carry.
Would you agree?
[AGREES IN FRENCH]
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels
that you do with rats,
do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?
And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.
However interesting
as the thought may be,
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know
why you don't like them.
All you know is
you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,
he looks everywhere
he would hide.
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Fhrer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of
once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe
as well?
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men
enter your home
and conduct
a thorough search
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities
to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have
something to tell me
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also,
that any information
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be,
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way
by the German military during the
rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard
any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening,
they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
[SNIFFLES]
Yes.
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
[SHUSHING]
It's the girl.
[SOBBING]

[PANTING]
Au revoir, Shosanna!
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
ALDO: Ten-hut!
My name is
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special
team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish
American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving
a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into
France dressed as civilians.
Once we're
in enemy territory,
as a bushwhacking
guerrilla army,
we're going to be doing one
thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know
about you all,
but I sure as hell didn't come down
from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,
cross 5, 000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily
and jump out of a fucking airplane to
teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac
and they need
to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a
bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,
they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got
a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be
that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel
to the Germans.
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.
And they will find
the evidence of our cruelty
in the disemboweled,
dismembered
and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able
to help themselves
but imagine the cruelty their
brothers endured at our hands,
and our boot heels
and the edge of our knives.
And the German
will be sickened by us.
And the German
will talk about us.
And the German
will fear us.
And when the German
closes their eyes at night
and they're tortured by their
subconscious for the evil they have done,
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL: Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command,
you take on debit.
A debit you owe me,
personally.
Each and every man under my
command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!

Then sit down.
How is your English,
Werner?
Because if need be, we got a
couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here,
an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there
you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
[BASTERDS LAUGHING]
MALE NARRATOR: The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity
among German soldiers
is simple.
As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up
against a wall,
the High Command decided
to send him back to Berlin
to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the
Basterds heard about him,
he never got there.
[GASPING]
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're
a big fan of your work.
When it comes
to killing Nazis...
[MAN GROANING]
...I think you show
great talent.
And I pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi
killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.
[BASTERDS LAUGHING]
Can I assume
you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
[BASTERDS WHOOPING]
Werner,
if you heard of us,
you probably heard we ain't in
the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG:
[LAUGHING] Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.
Either kill you
or let you go.
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive
depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece,
there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another
Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were
to have any crack shots,
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,
you got to show me on
this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many
they are, and you got to tell me
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.
[SCOFFING]
You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me. And
you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that
finger of yours
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held,
how many is coming and what
they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse,
sir.
[BATTAPPING]
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant
Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better
by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers
with a club.
He bashes their brains in with
a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to
ask you one last goddamn time,
and if you still
respectfully refuse,
I'm calling
The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take
that big bat of his,
and he's going to beat
your ass to death with it.
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,
and point out on this map
what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
[BASTERDS LAUGHING]
[BASTERDS APPLAUDING]
Actually, Werner, we're all
tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching
Donny beat Nazis to death
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!
DONNY: Yeah?
Got us a German here who
wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
[BAT TAPPING]
[CONTINUES TAPPING]
[BASTERDS CHEERING]
Did you get that
for killing Jews?
Bravery.
[BASTERDS EXCLAIMING]
Yeah!
BASTERD 1: Oh, no!
BASTERD 2: Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD: Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.
[LAUGHING]
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one,
on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it,
Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one
over here. Alive!
Get the fuck up! Batter
up. You're on deck!
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground.
English?
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
ALDO: Wicki.
Ask him
if he wants to live.
[BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN]
Tell him to point out on
this map the German position.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
[BASTERDS LAUGHING]
Ask him how many Germans.
[BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN]
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
[BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN]
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
Now, when you report
what happened here,
you can't tell them you told us
what you told us. They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why
you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you
could spread the word through the ranks
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
Now that you've survived the war, when
you get home, what you going to do?
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
WICKI: He's going
to hug his mother.
[SNIFFS]
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going
to take off his uniform.
[WICKI SPEAKING GERMAN]
[BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN]
WICKI: He's going
to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we
thought. We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
But you take off that uniform, ain't
nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit
well with us.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
So I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're
getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to
Carnegie Hall, don't you?

MAN: Right this way,

[CLEARS THROAT]
Lieutenant Archie Hicox
reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water,
I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself,
sir?
Whiskey. Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that
you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation
before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir,
such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,
and I've had
two books published.
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?
The first book
was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we
drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,
but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry
under the Third Reich. Explain
to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers
the films he's making
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.
An alternative
to what he considers
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,
how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels
has taken over,
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective
of Operation Kino,
blow up the basket.
And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist.
The Germans call them
the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds
will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.
Your contact
is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
[CHUCKLING] The German movie
star is working for England?
Yes, for the last
two years now.
One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was
in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good
with that.
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know
we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
[LAUGHS]
Well, now that you put it
like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not
exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets
on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.
She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.

ALDO: Speak English

I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max. We were in
here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting
and killing. It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name,
soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive
on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
[SHOUTING IN GERMAN]
ALDO: Who's that?
[GRUNTS]
Is the girl
on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
Wilhelm!
[SHOUTING IN GERMAN]
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
ALDO: Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say
we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm,
here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come
down there and take the girl away.
No guns. No guns me,
no guns you.
And we take the girl and
leave. It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way,
we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got,
son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
[SNIFFLES]
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine
gun? I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal,
we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff
ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us. You
decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades. They
drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.
No trust,
no deal.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.
[VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING]
Not so goddamn fast, doc. Tell
him to go play with his dogs.
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
[DOGS BARKING]
Before we yank that slug out you,
you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions
about what?
About I got three men
dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German
act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into
who shot John,
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't
see what happened inside,
that the Nazis being there
must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for
that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
[EXCLAIMING]
Everybody needs
to calm down.
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.
You met the sergeant
yourself. Willi.
You remember him,
don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become
a father!
His commanding officer gave him and
his mates the night off to celebrate.
[GROANS]
The Germans being there was either a
trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
[GRUNTING]
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman
gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would
and did notice it.
[BREATHING DEEPLY]
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms
with all the military there
would've been suicide.
But going as members
of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them
in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox
was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a
German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us
in that premiere?
You speak German better
than your friends? No.
Have I been shot? Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all,
by tomorrow night.
However, there's something
you don't know.
There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from
The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last
minute? That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to
do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending
the premiere.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old Uncle Adolf
makes this horse
a different color.
What is that
supposed to mean?
It means you getting us
in that premiere.
I'm probably going
to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?
[SNORTS]
Doggy doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up
in a cast,
and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it? You all
like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears
and just limp your little
ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?
We both speak
a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent,
no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have
a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most
Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best. Just
keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now?

Caught you flinching.
ALDO: Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you,
Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know
what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were
sitting where you're sitting,
would you
show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English
expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other
foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people
is my specialty,
so naturally, I worked for
the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them
were Jews. But Jew Hunter?
[SNORTS]
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to
admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache
and the Little Man?
What do you mean
the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little
surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,
as your reputation
would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's
Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo,
if you don't think
I wouldn't interrogate
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment,
both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero
Explosives still around their
ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot,
as of this moment,
is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?
However,
all I have to do is pick up
this phone right here,
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're
still alive, and that's one big if,
there ain't no way you're
going to take them boys
without setting off
them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you
for what you've done
to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four
to end the war.
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,
you may very well
get all four.
And if you get all four,
you end the war
tonight.
So, gentlemen,
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it,
since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,
if I do nothing,
it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you,
Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen,
I have no intention
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Goring and killing Bormann,
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,
only later to find myself
standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win
the war tonight,
we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
[EXCLAIMS]
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo! How fun.
But I digress. Where were
we? Yeah! Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it
is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the
other end of that radio
with the power of the pen
to authorize my,
let's call it, the terms
of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better
going down.
You know,
where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville,
Tennessee.
I've done my share
of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the
federal government calls illegal activity,
but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family
selling moonshine liquor, it
behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear
a story too good to be true,
it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would
probably say the same thing,
and 999. 999 times out of a
million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,
fate reaches out
and extends its hand.
What shall
the history books read?

HANS: So when the military
history of this night is written,
it will be recorded that I
was part of Operation Kino
from the very beginning
as a double agent.
Anything I've done in
my guise as an SS Colonel
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil
to establish my cover
with the Germans.
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite
in Hitler and Goebbels' opera
box that assured their demise.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
By the way, that last
part is actually true.
I want my full military pension
and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor
for my invaluable assistance in
the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the
members of Operation Kino
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like
the United States of America
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket Island
as a reward for all the
countless lives I've saved
by bringing the tyranny of
the National Socialist Party
to a swifter-than-imagined
end. Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa
and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over
driving of the truck
and bring them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.

Are you mad?

I made a deal with your

Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't

You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so. More like
chewed out. I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to
barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.
But I do have
one question.
When you get to your little
place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that
handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean,
if I had my way,
you'd wear that goddamn uniform for
the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware
that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're
going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.
[HANS SCREAMING]
You know something,
Utivich?
I think this just might be
my masterpiece.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?
State your business,
or prepare to get winged!
Calm yourselves gentlemen,
I mean you no harm.
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Good cold evening gentlemen,
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
that go by the name of
the Speck Brothers.
Might that be you?
Who wants to know?
Well, I do.
I'm Dr. King Schultz,
this is my horse, Fritz.
What kinda doctor?
Dentist.
Now are you the Speck Brothers,
and did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?
So what?
So, I wish to parley with you.
Speak English.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me,
it is a second language.
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
Hello you poor devils!
Is there one amongst you, who was formerly
a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Who said that?
What's your name?
Django.
Then you're exactly
the one I'm looking for.
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?
Who are they?
Big John
Ellis
and Raja
sometime they call him Lit'le Raj.
They was overseers at Carrucan plantation.
Not anymore.
Tell me
If you were to see any of these three
gentlemen again, would you recognize them?
Hey!
Stop talk with 'em like that.
Like what?
Like that!
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain-
Speak English, goddammit!
Everybody calm down,
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.
I don't care.
No sale.
Now off wit' you!
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
o'course they're for sale.
Move it.
My good man, did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture,
or are you pointing your weapon
at me with lethal intention?
Last chance, fancy pants.
Oh, very well
I'm sorry to have put
a bullet in your beast,
but I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You shot Roscoe!
And you killed Ace!
Hey, I only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me.
And I do believe I have
one, two, three, four, five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.
Damn legs busted!
No doubt. Now, if you can keep
your caterwauling down to a minimum,
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.
God fucking dammit!
As I was saying,
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers
again, you could recognize them?
Yeah.
Sold American!
So Mr. Speck,
Mr. Speck, how much
for young Django here?
That iron is nasty business.
Could you hold this for a moment?
Thank you.
Django, get up on that horse.
Also if I were you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Nigger, don't you touch my brother's coat!
Goddammit!
One hundred ten
twenty and five
for young Django here.
And since you won't be needing it anymore,
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
Also Mr. Speck, I am afraid
I will require a bill of sale.
Do you have one?
You go to hell, dentist!
I thought not.
No worries!
I come prepared.
Thank you.
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
Now as to you poor devils
So as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,
you gentlemen have two choices.
One: once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,
then carry him to the nearest town.
Which would be at least thirty-seven
miles back the way you came.
Or Two:
You could unshackle yourselves
take that rifle, put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.
The choice is yours.
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is that one.
Tata.
Now wait a minute fellas,
let's talk about this.
You gotta be reasonable
on a situation like this.
I'm not a bad guy,
look I'm just doing my job!
Blueberry, didn't I give you
my last apple?
Tell you what boys, take me to Lit'le Duck
in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.
No. No, please-
What's everybody staring at?
They never seen a nigger
on a horse before.
Good morning inn keeper!
Two beers for two weary travelers.
Ah, it's still a bit early.
We won't be open for another hour.
By then we'll be servin' breakfast.
Wow wow wow wow!
What the hell you think you doin', boy?
Get that nigger outta here.
Help! Help!
Inn keeper!
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshall.
Alas
Now we must act
as our own bartender.
Sit down, my boy.
What kinda dentist are you?
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.
These days I practice a new profession.
Bounty Hunter.
D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
No.
Well
The way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
Prost.
The state places a bounty on a man's head,
I track that man, I find
that man, I kill that man,
after I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities,
and sometimes that's
easier said then done,
I show that corpse to the authorities
proving, yes indeed,
I truly have killed him, at which point
the authorities pay me the bounty.
So like slavery, it's a
flesh-for-cash business.
What's a bounty?
It's like a reward.
You kill people and
they give you a reward?
Certain people, yeah.
Bad people?
Aah!
Badder they are, bigger the reward!
Which brings me to you.
And I must admit that I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.
On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand
I need your help, if you're not
in a position to refuse, all the better.
So for the time being, I'm gonna make
this slave malarkey work to my benefit.
Still having said that
I feel guilty.
So
I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
However I've had this endeavor,
I'm- I'm at a slight disadvantage,
in so far as, I don't
know what they look like.
But you do don't you?
I know what they look like, all right.
Good.
So here's my agreement.
You travel with me until we find them-
Where we goin'?
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find them.
And when we find them
you point them out, and I kill them!
You do that, I agree to
give you your freedom,
twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother
-that's seventy-five dollars,
and as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.
Okay boys, fun's over.
Come on out.
All right folks, calm down.
You bout your business.
The jokers will be gone soon.
Now
why y'all wanna come into
my town and start trouble,
and scare all these nice people?
You ain't got nothin' better to do,
than to come into Bill Sharp's
town and show your ass?
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Now you can get the marshall.
Marshall, marshall!
Should we wait inside?
Can't we just leave?
After you.
Move that buckboard long ways
'cross the street from the saloon!
I want six men, six riffles behind it.
I want two men, two rifles
up on this roof,
two men two rifles on that roof.
All the barrels aimed at that front door.
Somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.
You in the saloon!
We got a hundred riffles aimed
on every way outta that buildin'!
You got once chance git outta this alive!
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,
and I mean, right now!
Is this the marshall I have
the pleasure of addressing?
Yes it is.
This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
That wunderbar, marshall.
I have relieved myself of all weapons,
and just as you have instructed,
I am ready to step outside,
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust,
as a representative of the criminal justice
system of The United States of America,
I shan't be shot down in the street,
by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.
You mean like you did our sheriff?
Shot 'em down like a dog in the street!
Yes, that's exactly what I mean!
Do I have your word as a lawman,
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy
seein' somethin' like that,
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.
Fair enough marshall, here we come!
They're a little tense out there.
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.
Come ahead.
You unarmed?
Yes indeed we are.
Marshall Tatum, may I address
you and your deputies,
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,
as to the incident that just occurred?
Go on.
My name is Dr. King Schultz,
and like yourself, marshall,
I am a servant of the court.
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his
head of two hundred dollars.
Now, that's two hundred dollars,
dead or alive.
The hell you say!
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff
sometime in the last two years.
I know this because three years ago,
he was rustling cattle from the B.C.
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.
Now this is a warrant,
made out by circuit court Judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.
You're encouraged to wire him.
He'll back up who I am,
and who your dear departed sheriff was.
In other words marshall,
you owe me two hundred dollars.
I'll be damned.
After this Brittle business
is behind us
you'll be a free man.
With a horse, seventy five
dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?
Find my wife
and buy her freedom.
Django
I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves believe in marriage?
Me and my wife do.
All men in Carrucan did,
and that's why we uh
we run off.
Django
Django, Django
You got sand, Django.
Boy's got sand.
I got no use for niggers with sand.
I want you to burn the runaway r
right here on his cheek.
And the girl too.
And I want you to take 'em
to the Greenville auction,
and sell 'em
Both of 'em
Separately.
And this one
you will sell him cheap.
In Greenville?
There should be some
sort of a records office.
You know when she was sold
you know where she came from
and you know her name.
What is her name?
Broomhilda.
What?
Broom-hilda.
Broomhilda?
Hm-hm.
Were her owners German?
Yeah, how you know?
She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation,
she was raised by a German mistress.
Von Shafts.
She speak a little German too.
Your wife?
Hm-hm.
When she was little, her mistress taught
her so she has somebody speak German with.
Alright, let me get this straight.
Your slave wife speaks German,
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
Yep.
They call me Hildi.
When we gain access to these plantations,
we'll be putting on an Act.
You'll be playing a character.
Hm?
No?
But during the act,
you can never break character.
D'you understand?
Yeah. Don't break character.
And you character is that of the Valet.
What that is?
That's a fancy word for servant.
Valet.
Hm-hm!
And now Django, you may chose
your character's costume.
You want that I pick up my own clothes?
You- but of course!
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.
This is my valet,
my valet does not walk.
I said niggers on horses-
His name is Django, he's a free man,
he can ride what he pleases.
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers he can't.
My good sir
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr. King Schultz,
this is my valet Django,
and these are our horses
Tony and Fritz.
Mr. Bennett,
I've been lead to believe that you are
a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas
to Tennessee to
parley with you now.
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?
No appointment, no nuttin'?
Oh, I'm afraid so.
Well what if I had to say I don't
like you, or your fancy pants nigger,
and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn.
Now what'cha gotta say about that?
Mr. Bennett,
if you are the business man
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things, I might
say, that could change your mind.
Well com'on inside, and get yourself
somethin' cool to drink.
Huh?
Hm-hm.
Oh maybe, while we discuss business,
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures
to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.
Oh, absolutely!
Eh, Betina!
Yessir, Big Daddy?
Eh What's your Jimmie name again?
Django.
Django.
Betina sugar, could you take Django there,
and take him around the grounds here
to show him all the pretty stuff.
As you please, Big Daddy.
Oh, Mr. Bennett,
I must remind you Django is a free man.
He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must
be treated as an extension of myself.
Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
Yes, sir?
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man. You understand?
You can't treat him like any
of these other niggers around here,
cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?
You wan' I should
treat him like white folks?
No.
That's not what I said.
Then I don't know
what'cha want, Big Daddy.
Yes I can see that.
Uh
What's the name of that peckawood boy
from town that works with the glass?
His mama works at the lumber yard.
Oh, you mean Jerry.
That's the boy's name, Jerry!
You know Jerry, don't you sugar?
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.
Well that's it then
You just treat 'em like you would Jerry.
The house we just left from,
is the big house.
Big daddy call it that, cause it's big.
That there is the pantry.
That's where Bid Daddy
hang out his day meat.
Full o'squirrels.
What'cha do for your massa'?
Didn't you hear him tell ya
I ain't no slave?
So you really free?
Yes. I as free.
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Betina, I need to ask you something.
What'cho want?
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers, overseers.
Their name is Brittle. Do you know 'em?
Brittle?
Yes, Brittle.
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle. Sometime called Li'le Raj.
I don't know dem.
They could be usin' a different name.
They would have come to
the plantation this past year.
You mean The Shaffers?
Maybe. Three brother?
Ah-huh.
Are they here?
Ah-huh.
Could you point one of 'em out to me?
Well one's over in that field.
Old man Carrucan ain't going
to appreciate this now, she- she-
she work in a house, John,
you could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess it up,
she ain't gonna be worth no-
she ain't gonna
worth a damn thing.
Like- like the bible say
Look, I- I told you, I was
the one to make her do it.
You're ready?
She the one who went up for me and,
thing about you we gettin' whipped now,
that should be me! That should be me John,
I been here long enough, you know me!
You know me a long time, now!
You know master Carrugen
ain't gonna appreciate this!
She's- she's a house slave!
Looking for freedom
Looking for freedom ah-aah
Please, please now.
If this what you want, to keep me funny
fighting for each other, please
I like the way you beg, boy.
Is that who you was lookin' for?
Yep.
Where the other two of 'em?
They by the stable, punishin'
Little Jody for breakin' eggs.
They whippin' Little Jody?
Point me in that direction.
You go to that tree,
and keep goin' that way.
Go git that white man I came here with.
Com'on now.
Com'on, Jody!
Let me all get you set up!
And the Lord said the fear of ye
and the dread of ye
shall be on every beast of here.
Hey, gimme that of what?
You better gimme that arm,
you gotta gimme that arm!
Okay, she ready!
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.
John Brittle!
Remember me?
I like the way you die, boy!
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch!
Ya'all wanna see somethin'?
Ooh no!
Who are they?
That's Big John, and that's little Raj.
Where's Ellis?
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.
You sure that's him?
Yeah.
Positive?
I dunno.
You don't know if you're positive?
I don't know what positive means.
It means you're sure.
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes I'm sure it is Ellis Brittle.
I'm positive he dead.
Django!
Everybody calm down,
we mean no one else any harm.
Who are you two jokers?
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America,
the man to my left is Django
Freeman, he's my deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant
signed by circuit court judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas,
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive, of
John Brittle, Roger Brittle,
and Ellis Brittle.
They've gone by the name Shaffer.
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers real name was Brittle.
These are wanted men.
The law wants them for murder.
Now I reiterate,
the warrant states dead or alive,
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.
I realize
passions are high,
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a office of the court
in the performance of his duty is,
you will be hung by the neck
until you're dead.
May I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?
Gimmie.
Satisfied?
May I have that back, please?
Get off my land.
Post haste.
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can,
and let's get out of here.
Hell
That's 'em sonsabitches.
Now unless they start shootin' first
nobody shoot 'em.
That's way too simple for these jokers.
We're gonna whip
that nigger lover to death.
And I'm gonna personally strip
and clip that garboon myself.
Damn
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.
We ready, or what?
Ah hold on, I'm fuckin'
with my eye holes.
Oh shit.
I just made it worse.
Who made this goddamn shit?
Willard's wife.
Wll mk yu wn gddmn mk!
Look, nobody's sayin' they
don't appreciate what Jenny did.
Well if all I hadda do
was cut a hole in a bag,
I coulda cut it better than this.
How 'bout you Robert, can you see?
Not too good.
I mean, if I don't move my head,
I can see pretty good, more or less.
But when I start ridin', the bag's
moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
Oh shit!
I just made mine worse.
Anybody bring any extra bags?
No, nobody brought an extra bag!
I'm just asking.
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?
Oh well Shitfire!
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose.
Well I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing,
and I can't ride in this fucking thing!
Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!
Ya know I watched my wife work all day
gettin' thirty bags to get ready
for you ungrateful sonsabitches,
and all I hear is criticize,
criticize, criticize.
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!
Now look
Let's not forget why we're here.
We gotta killer nigger
over that hill there.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.
Okay, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off.
I think we all think
the bags was a nice idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But not pointing 'ny fingers,
they could have been done better.
So how about no bags this time,
but next time, we do the bags right,
and then we go full regalia.
I get my bag off.
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.
But nobody can see.
So?
So, it be nice to see.
Goddamit! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see. So what?
All that matters is
can the fuckin' horse see!
That's a raid!
Where's this shit!
There he is!
Get that nigger out from under 'at wagon.
And get that nigger lover
out o'the wagon!
That nigger ain't down here!
They're gone!
What?
They tricked us!
Well where are they?
Auf wiedersehen.
Bull time.
We get 'em now.
Cowards tend to do that.
Goddammit!
Would you care to?
I can't see shit out of this
He's getting away.
I got 'em.
Big Daddy's getting away.
I got 'em.
Got 'em.
For kids, ain't that short.
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters were German?
Broomhilda is a German name.
If they named her, it stands
to reason they'd be German.
Lots of gals where you from
named Broomhilda?
Broomhilda is the name of a character
in the most popular
of all the German legends.
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Oh yes, there is.
Do you know it?
Every German knows that story.
Would you like me to tell you?
Well
Broomhilda was a princess.
She was the daughter of Wotan,
the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
What she do?
I can't exactly remember.
I think she disobeys him in some way.
So he puts her on top of the mountain.
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere.
And he puts a fire breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.
And there, Broomhilda shall remain,
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.
Does a fella arise?
Yes Django. As a matter of fact, he does.
A fella named Sigfried.
Does Sigfried save her?
Quite spectacularly so.
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.
And he walks through hellfire
because Broomhilda's worth it.
I know how he feel.
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
Now Look Django
I don't doubt that one day
you will save your lady love.
But I can't let you go to Greenville
in a good conscious.
Slave Washington, in Mississippi,
isn't a place for you to visit.
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
But let me ask you a question.
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?
Kill white folks, and they pay you for it?
What's not to like?
And I have to admit, we make a good team.
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?
Yeah, on that occasion,
you were a tad overzealous,
but normally, that's a good thing.
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?
What'd ya mean partner up?
You work with me through
the winter till the snow melts.
I give you a third of my bounties.
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself,
and we'll find where they sent your wife.
Why you care what happen to me?
Why you care if I find my wife?
Frankly
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.
Plus when a German meets a real life
Sigfried, that's kind of a big deal.
As a German, I'm obliged to help you
on your quest to rescue
your beloved Broomhilda.
Ooh, what happened to mister
I wanna shoot white folks for money?
His son's with him.
Well good.
He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word.
That's better then most of them get,
and a damn sight better then he deserves.
Put down the rifle.
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
Just take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Read it aloud.
Consider that today's lesson.
Wanted, dead or alive.
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall
gang.
For murder and stagecoach ro
robbery.
Seven zero zero ze-
Seven thousand.
Seven-
Thousand.
Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall,
one thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang
memb
members.
Known members of the Smitty
Bacall Gang are as fellows,
follows.
follows.
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and
Crazy Craig Koons.
That is who Smitty Bacall is.
If Smitty Bacall wanted to
start a farm at twenty-two,
they would never have printed that.
But Smitty Bacall wanted
to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.
D'you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?
This is what I do.
I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash.
This corpse is worth
seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin'
and shoot him.
Pa?
Pa!
Here
You need to keep
this Smitty Bacall handbill.
Why?
It's good luck.
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.
That's accurate.
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?
Who the hell have you got there?
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe,
and three of their acolytes.
Huh.
Well just leave 'em out here,
they ain't goin' nowhere.
Let's comin' outta the snowy snow and
git yourself some coffee.
Had a birthday yesterday, got some cake!
Pretty good.
Move along!
Do it, walk!
Keep moving.
Don't let that mud
slow you down, keep going.
Keep on.
Broomhilda Von Shaft, age twenty-seven,
r on right cheek
Calvin Candy.
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.
Candyland?
Oh so you've heard of it?
Ain't no slave that ain't
heard of Candyland.
Well, apparently that's where you wife is,
and that's the repelling
gentleman who owns her.
Let's just hope she works in the out,
slaying in the field.
Oh no, she ain't in the field, mate.
She she pretty.
and she a tall girl, too.
The one you tore back up on the nag
he burnt her runaway on her cheek.
They got damned.
She no field nigger, but she ain't good
enough for the house no more either.
They're gonna try to make
her comfort girl.
What's a comfort-
Oh.
Now while I got freedom
Now while I got my gun.
So do we offer to buy her?
So
say
a man wants to buy a horse
needs to buy a horse.
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door,
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
And you know what the farmer says,
the farmer says: No.
Well I say: fuck that farmer.
And I'm stealin' that horse.
Fair enough, but now you are horse thief,
and they hang horse thieves.
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner,
because the horse is still its property.
We need her and we need a bill of sale.
But if we ain't gonna try to buy,
then how we gonna get it?
May I offer an alternative
plan for action?
Go ahead.
The man walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door,
and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm,
and makes an offer so ridiculous,
the farmer's forced to say yes.
We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?
No, it's far too big, but apparently,
this farmer ain't all about the farm.
How much do you know
about mandingo fighting?
What?
Can you convincingly masquerade of someone
who's an expert on mandingo fighting?
Why?
Because my character is that of
a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,
here in Greenville to buy my way
into the mandingo fight game,
and your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.
They call that One-Eyed Charly.
Bonjour.
Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire,
we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candy.
Enter.
Thank you.
You want me to play a black slaver?
Ain't nothin lower than a black slaver.
A black slaver is lower
than a head house nigger.
And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.
Then play him that way,
give me your black slaver.
Dr. Schultz!
Good to see you again.
Mr. Moguy.
Thank you for your assistance in creating
the opportunity for this appointment.
Nonsense, it's my job.
So, this is the One-Eyed Charly
I've heard so much about.
Yes, this is Django Freeman.
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.
Just call me Leo.
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room,
y'all wanna follow me?
How long have you
been associated with Mr. Candie?
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about eleven
when we went to boarding school together.
Calvins' father father
put me through law school.
One could almost say, I was
raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
One could almost say, you's a nigger.
What did you say?
I say
Real nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
Ah, what civilized people aren't?
And he prefers Monsieur
Candie to Mister Candie.
Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il prfre.
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
Get back on top now, turn around.
There you go.
There you go.
Why do you want to get
in the mandingo business?
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?
Quit stalling now.
Answer the question.
The awful truth?
Pff, I'm bored.
This seems like a good bit of fun.
Well, come on over.
We got us a fight goin' on,
that's a good bit of fun.
Won't you accompany me to the bar?
You don't go ahead in a house,
white man, even I know that.
Dr. Schultz
What a real pleasure-
Keep fighting, niggers!
.. and I might add, an honor.
Honored to meet you, please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.
Get Freeman Django here whatever he wants.
And I'll have sweet gin bourbon.
You go way, boy,
you do what I tell you!
He's got big and strong!
Com'on now!
Ah, he's not doing what I told him.
For God sake.
Bravo, Luigi, cosi e dai.
De casse piu rapido.
Com'on now boys,
this a fight to the death!
Hit that animal or you're ain't!
Ecco i con la spola tappeto.
La spola tappeto gi.
Big Fred, com'on!
Turn him around, now!
Use your strength, boy!
Com'on now, use your strength!
There you go!
There you go!
Look at that!
Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.
Do what I told you, boy.
Here you go!
Ah. No! Aah!
Do what I told you.
Ground him back, boy.
Ground him back!
Uh, you no lose!
No! No!
Finish him.
Go on, boy, finish him!
That's why they call him big Fred!
Worth every penny.
Well, arrivederchi, Luigi!
Com'on up now boy, get yourself a rest,
you did a fine job, a real fine job.
Proceed in.
Tequila.
What's your name?
Django.
Can you spell it?
D, J, A, N, G, O.
The D is silent.
I know.
Umberto, andiamo.
Mr. Moguy,
I want you to take care
o' my new boy here.
You find him a room with a soft bed,
and you bring him up
a pony to lick his pawl.
You be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow mornin' now, you hear?
Yessir, Mr. Candy.
Oh before you go, Roscoe,
get Fred here a tall beer.
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.
Yessir.
What's your name, boy?
His name is Django Freeman.
Hm-hm.
Where did ya dig him up?
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.
I've heard tell about you.
I heard you've been telling ev'rybody
that mandingos are not damn good,
ain't nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying, I'm curious.
What makes you such a mandingo expert?
I'm curious what makes you so curious?
What did you say, boy?
Calm down Butch.
No offense given
None taken.
Uh, Monsieur Candie
Uhm, I'd appreciate if you could direct
your line of inquiry toward me.
One.
You do not have anything to drink,
can I get you a tasty refreshment.
Yes! I'll have a beer.
Wunderbar.
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,
and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver,
do no spill the rum.
Doc
I'm a seasoned slaver, you are-
well, you are a neophyte,
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this
cowboy here is taking advantage of you.
With all due respect,
Monsieur Candie,
I didn't seek you out for your advice.
I sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was under the impression
when you granted me an audience,
it would be to discuss business.
But we weren't talking business yet.
We were discussing my curiosity.
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.
Sheba,
you stay right there.
I know you didn't name me.
Prost.
Jambo.
Now according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,
I'm doin' business with both of y'all.
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold, is that it?
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
So
Bright Boy,
Moguy tells me you looked
over my African flesh,
and you was none too impressed, huh?
Not for top dollar.
Well then we got nothing
more to talk about.
You see, you wanna buy
a beat ass nigger from me,
those was all the beat ass
niggers I wanna sell, so
He don't wanna buy
the niggers you wanna sell.
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.
I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.
Well, hm. You won't sell your best.
You won't even sell your second best.
But your third best
you don't want to sell him either
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it
who knows what could happen?
And what do you consider ridiculous?
For a truly talented specimen,
well The Right Nigger?
How much would you say, Django?
Twelve thousand dollars.
Gentlemen
You had my curiosity.
Now you have my attention.
Willie Willie.
Hold up! Hold up.
Aah.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good Dr. Schultz.
Beautiful morning isn't it?
You couldn't have picked a better one.
Please, won't you take a ride
with us here in the Victorian.
Oh, thank you very much.
Tie your horse up back there.
Django!
Well I part company from many
of my phenologist colleagues,
cause I believe
there's a level above bright,
above talented, above loyal
that a nigger can aspire.
Say one nigger that just
pops up on ten thousand.
The exceptional nigger.
Bright day uh, Bright Boy?
Sun is up.
Shinin' on all of us.
Have a seat, Doc.
Great an honor.
The honor is all ours.
Thank you.
.. but I do believe that given time,
exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here,
will come if not freedom
more freedom
Bright Boy,
you are that one in ten thousand.
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.
Touch your guns, you're dead.
Everybody calm down!
I saw the whole thing, no harm done.
Are you- are you kiddin' me, this nigger-
I said no harm done!
Now take your hands off your pistol!
Butch!
That means you too.
Ev'rybody stop antagonizing my guests.
Who!
Git back upon your horse.
He broke my collarbone!
For God sake, somebody please help Who
here back upon his goddamn horse.
Ooh, now you are one lucky nigger.
You got to listen to your boss, white boy.
Oh I'm a good walk in
any moonlight for you.
You wanna hold my hand?
Willie!
Take us home.
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?
No sir.
You wan' a boot heel in it?
No sir.
Then keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
Flash that bad look at me again,
I give you a reason not to like me.
Now move, nigger!
You niggers gonna understand
somethin' 'bout me.
I'm worse than any o'these white men here.
You keep them eyelash inside your ass,
you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't it?
Indeed!
May you stop for a moment,
so I may put put a word in my man's ear?
Yeah, I'm expecting to fall in love once
I see the specimen of Candyland,
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have
a confidential strategy
meeting with my confident.
You mind tellin' me
what the hell you doing?
I've confirmed that
Broomhilda's at Candyland.
Are you sure it's her?
He didn't call her by name,
but she's a young lady,
whip marks on her
back, and speaks German.
Now while it's not wise to assume,
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.
Point being
don't get so carried away
with your retribution.
We lose sight on why we're here.
You think I lost sight, did I?
Yes, I do! Stop antagonizing Candy!
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get both of us killed,
and I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.
I'm not antagonizing.
I'm intriguing him.
You- you're yelling abuse
of these poor slaves!
I recall the man.
who had me killed another
man in front o' his son,
and he didn't bat an eye.
Remember that?
Yeah of course I remember!
What you said was
You said, this ain't my word
In my word you got to get dirty.
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm getting dirty.
Well you're paraphrasing a tad, but
that was it generally, just
see you at Candyland.
Alright niggers!
Back at it.
That means you too, moonlight.
I'll 'be. D'Artagnan!
Now well, why do a fool thing
like run off?
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candy.
Yes you can!
Yu mght nt b bl t wn,
but yur n fght.
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up,
I cannot hear myself think!
Hush now, Marsha! Hush up, Marsha!
Marsha, hush up!
Hey, get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!
Well now boy
Gidown o' that tree.
Yes sir.
How long was he lose?
A night
day
Half the other night.
How far he git off property?
Bout twenty miles off prop.
Pretty fer, conside'ing that limp he got.
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?
One of this new lot.
The way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.
Please Mr. Candy, I ain't got it,
ain't it no more, I can't-
No no no no,
now no beggin'
No playin' on my soft heart.
You're in trouble, now son.
I done paid 500 dollars for you
When I pay 500 dollars
I expect to get five fights outta a nigga
'fore he rollover and play dead.
Got to understand, I'm
I'm running a business here!
You- you fought three fights.
But I won everyone!
Yes you did. Yes you did,
but that last one, you muddled the line
between winning and losing.
Still the fact remain.
I pay 500 dollars,
I want five goddamn fights!
So what 'bout my
five hundred dollars, huh?
What about my five hundred dollars?
You go n' reimburse me?!
You even know what reimburse means?
I'll reimburse you!
You will?
You pay 500 dollars
for pratic'lly a one eyed Ole'Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?
No, he won't.
He's just tired of you
toyin' with him, is all.
Matter o' facts, so am I.
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny,
ain't got no use for 'em,
ain't that right, Doc?
You heard 'em!
I'm gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher slack jaw gaze, he
he ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life.
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
That right.
That matter
Won't have that.
Now
Sin'e as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger anyway I see fit?
He's your nigger.
Mr. Stonesipher?
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Marsha! Git the nigger!
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills
for a blood sport like 'nigger fightin'?
No.
He just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.
You are used to it?
I'm just a little more use
to American's than he is.
Now Monsieur Candy,
whenever you're ready.
We rode five hours so you could
show off your stock.
Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's an example
I ain't impressed.
Follow me.
Line up to the left here now niggers.
That's it.
You gimme a line, gimme a line.
Get in line here. Right now!
Hello, Steven my boy!
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.
Who this nigger up on that nag?
Oh Steven, you have nags for breakfast.
What's the matter, why so ornery,
you miss me, huh?
Oh-oh yes sir, I miss you like
a home miss flower,
like a - like a- a baby miss Mum n' Teddy,
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.
Now I ask you:
who this nigger, on that nag?
Hey Snowball.
If you wanna know my name
or the name of my horse, you ask me.
Just who the hell you
callin' Snowball, horse boy?
I'll snap your black ass of
that nag there in the mud-
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven.
Let's keep it funny.
Django here is a Freeman.
This nigger here?
That nigger there.
Let me at least introduce the two of you.
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Steven.
Steven, this is Django.
You two ought to hate each other.
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feel the need to entertain?
Django, and his friend in grey
here Dr. Schultz are customers,
and they are our guests, Steven,
and you, you old decrepit bastard,
are to show them every hospitality.
You understand that?
Yessir, here I'm understandin',
but I don't know why I gotta
take lip off this nigger?
You don't hafta know why.
Do you understand?
Yes sir, I understand.
Oh good!
They're spendin' the night, go up in the
guest bedrooms and get two ready.
He gonna stay in the Big House?
Steven, he's a slaver.
It's different.
In the Big House?
Well you gotta problem with that?
No, no no I got no problem with it,
with you I gotta problem with burnin'
the bed, the sheets, the pillow cases,
ev'rything up when this
black ass motherfuckers gone!
Now that is my problem,
they are mine to burn!
Now your problem right now
is making a good impression.
And I want you to start
solving that problem right now,
and git them goddamn rooms ready!
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Go on now.
Can't believe you brought a nigger
to stay in the Big House.
You get a rollin' over and
it's God man free right now.
He had a lip on you.
A nigger in the estate part.
What shit is that!?
Now.
Where is my beautiful sister!
There she is!
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
southern belle is my widowed sister.
Darling, you are a diamond for tired eyes.
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie,
you'll git your ass up on that hill.
Com'on Charlie, go on now.
Go, com'on now.
You know where it is.
Like you on a rope!
Niggers don't walk 'round here!
Niggers run!
Ah, Monsieur Candie?
Hmm?
About that matter, about the nigger girl
we were talking about?
Nigger girl?
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German?
Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?
Do you think before the demonstration
you could send her around to my room?
You little Dickens, you!
I don't see why not.
Steven, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,
get her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room.
Actually, Monsieur Candie, it's-
it's somethin' I ain't tole you that yet.
What?
Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.
What's she doin' there?
What 'cha think she doin' there,
in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.
What did she do?
She ran off again.
Jesus Christ Steven, how many
people ran away while I was gone?
Two.
And when did she go?
Last night, they- they
brought her back this morning.
How bad did
Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Lucky for her, they was
out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.
Bill and Cody went out lookin' for her,
found her and brought her back, uh
Now she a little beat up,
but- but she done that the all damn self,
runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.
How long she been in the box?
How long ya think, she been
in there all damn day!
And the lit'le bitch got ten
more days be in there.
Steven, take her out.
Take her out, why?!
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.
Hildi is my nigger, Southern hospitality
dictates I make her available to him.
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran off.
Jesus Christ Steven, what is the point
of havin' a nigger that speaks German,
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?
Now I realize it is inconvenient
but still, you take her ass out!
Yes sir.
Lara Lee, will you and Cora
be responsible for getting
Hilda cleaned up and
presentable for Dr. Schultz here?
Of course, darling.
Now gentlemen, I do apologize, but I'm
wearer for our travels beyond words,
it is time for me to rest my tired ass.
Ya'all have heard the man,
get yar ass, all part of it.
Go! Come here!
Get over there, get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to doctor
what- what did you say
your name is, Schut?
Schultz.
Schultz!
Git her back over here, alright girl?
Yes sir.
Hilda, you comin with me, or you
gonna sleep in that lit'le box over here?
Hello ladies.
Dr. Schultz, may I introduce
to you Broomhilda.
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
I've heard a lot of good things about you.
Well, it's not often a nigger
speaks German, don't you know?
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,
I could see all the passion
you inspire completely justified.
The doctor here speaks German!
And I've been informed you do as well?
Go ahead girl, speak a little German.
Astonishing.
And I should bring-
Much obliged.
Don't be afraid.
Pardon.
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
You silver tongued devil you.
Look Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
But the best three, by far, were:
Sampson
Well, what's his name again?
Goldie.
Goldie and Eskimo Joe.
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
Oh, you never know how these
nigger nicknames get started.
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold, who knows?
Well, regardless,
Samson's your best,
we all know that,
you will never sell him,
and I can see why, he's a champion.
Hm-hm-hm!
All three are champions.
Samson's champion.
Them other two pretty good.
Calvin, what that nigger- you let-
That's alright, that's alright.
You have to understand Monsieur Candie,
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.
Is that right?
Hence I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.
I need something
more than just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache.
Need to have what what what?
Panache, hum
A sense of showmanship!
Showmanship, yes.
I want to be able to bill him
him as the Black Hercules.
Black Hercules, isn't that clever?
More like niggerly.
I said, and I quote:
I would pay top dollar
for the Right Nigger.
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger per se
but is he right as rain?
Dr. Schultz,
I will have you know,
there is no one in the nigger
fight game that appreciates
the value of showmanship more
than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.
Nobody.
But one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game.
And that is a nigger that can win fights.
Now that should be your first, second,
third, four, and fifth concern.
Now after you have that,
and you know you have that,
then you can start to
implement a grand design.
In other words, first thing is first.
First thing is first.
I see you two gettin' on.
Famously.
Oh Monsieur Candie, you can't
imagine what it's like
not to hear you native
tongue in four years.
Well hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.
Two weeks in Boston,
oh that's your- oh man!
Ah, two weeks in Boston!
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.
Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,
you might have caught yourself
a little dose of Nigella.
Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.
It's like a pool of black tar,
once it catches your ass, you can't-
Yessir, you can't.
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but
it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.
Well naturally, it is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,
not the plucked chicken.
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself,
you are quite a dapper European gentleman.
You gotta finish this, you got to put your
elbow in this, this is, do you hear me-
You know that nigger, don't ya?
Who?
Who?
Don't who me bitch,
you know who I'm talking about!?
At the table?
I don't know him.
You don't know him?
No.
No what?
No sir.
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
Okay
If- if you say so.
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.
But if it was my money
I wouldn't pay no twelve
thousand dollars for him.
What would your price be?
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,
and I don't know why I would
be inclined to be generous
nine thousand
maybe.
Dr. Schultz
Let me reclarify how this
whole negotiation came about.
You see, it wasn't me who came
to you to sell a nigger,
Sure, it wasn't.
It was you who approached me to buy one.
Sure it was.
Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
that ain't too far off from right,
and if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,
I could do so any day of the week.
Any day.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em.
It was only your
ridiculous offer
of twelve thousand dollars
that made me even consider it.
Hmm-hmm.
You know Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.
Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
Hurray, doctor, hurray,
and a wise decision, that is!
However, that is a tremendous
amount of money.
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,
I have a lawyer,
a persnickety man named Tuttle,
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe
examined by a physician of my choosing.
Naturally.
So say I return in about
.. five days time.
Five days ?!
With my Mr. Tuttle.
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy can hash out
the finer details between themselves.
I say splendid Doctor
Splendid.
Gentlemen
may I propose a toast
to Eskimo Joe.
Or, shall we call him
the Black Hercules.
To the Black Hercules.
The Black Hercules!
The Black Hercules
You was right, Doctor,
that name do help pay an ass.
Hildi
I'm outta drink, girl.
So Hildi how you like servin'
at the big table in the big house, huh?
When Monsieur Candy talk to you,
you answers.
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
Hmm-hmm.
It's a lot better than
sizzling in that hot box,
or draggin' your ass
through a bramble bush.
Maybe it's not quite as much fun as
getting the pleasure o' the mandingos,
huh sugar babe?
Hmm oh, she like them new.
Like Simpson, huh?
Yessir.
You know Monsieur Candie,
Hmm?
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,
since how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.
Dr. Schultz, when you
was alone with Hildi here,
did- didja just speak German, or
did ya git her clothes off?
No, we just talked and
Oh so- so you haven't seen her back?
I haven't-
No no no, now Steven's right,
you might find this interesting.
Hildi, com'on take off your dress,
show Dr. Schultz your back here, go on!
Uh, Calvin, I just got her all
dressed up and looking nice.
But Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from
Dusseldorf,they don't got niggers there.
He's a man of medicine.
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers endurance for pain.
These niggers are tough
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
Hilda's got somethin' like
four lashes on her back.
Lare Lee, just get-
why don't you lose her goddamn mat?
Look a' that, doctor, it's like
a painting, look at that.
Calvin!
We are eating, ain't no one
wanna look at her whipped up back!
Fine. Fine, fine fine fine
After the dinner, Steven.
After dinner.
During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?
Cora, come get this girl!
She all messed.
Yes ma'am?
Oh! Why are you all undone?
I just got you done,
now come over, here!
Baby, you got Steven his bad side,
when you need to be on his blind side.
You said you ain't know him?
Huh?
I said you said you ain't know him.
I don't.
Yes you do.
Mister Steven
I don't.
Why is you lyin' to me?
I ain't.
Then why is you cry?
You scarin' me.
Why is I'm scarin' you?
Because you scary.
.. to speak German this afternoon
with Hildi, was positively soul enriching.
You stay in that chair.
You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
Oh yes.
Yesiree Bob I did.
In that case allow me
to propose another proposition.
I'm all ears.
Hurry up, goddammit!
Monsieur Candie-
Steven!
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here!
Uhm sorry doctor Schultz,
my ears ain't worth a damn these days.
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen.
You mean get up outta my chair?
If you could manage it.
Why?
It's about dessert.
What about dessert?
I'd rather discuss that in private.
We're havin' white cake.
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?
You right Monsieur Candy, you right,
I'll handle it myself.
Meet me in the library.
I just can't understand why
you won't come talk to the evening,
she get fucked up 'round here,
you blame me.
Fine, fine friend Steven, I
will be along momentarily.
Yessir.
Well
gentlemen
as you can see, talented as they are
no doubt in the kitchen,
from time to time
adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
You may clear the dinner service.
Hurry up girl.
So Dr. Schultz
Why don't you regal us
with the tale of the circus?
The circus!
What is the matter?
Them motherfuckers ain't here
to buy no mandingos.
They wants that girl.
Steven, what the hell
are you talkin' about, hm?
They playin' your ass for a fool,
that what I'm talkin' bout.
They ain't here for
no muscle bound jimmie,
they here for that girl.
What what girl.
What Hildi?
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?
Them niggers know each other.
He he just bought Eskimo Joe.
Did he give you any money?
No, not yet, but they go-
Then he didn't buy diddly,
not yet no how.
But he's just about to buy who he come
here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Steven.
You're welcome Calvin.
Whe- where you gettin' all this?
Why would they go through all
that trouble for a nigger with a-
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth three hundred dollars?
They're doin' it cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.
She probably his wife.
Now, why that German give a fuck who that
uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.
If she's who they want
why this whole snake oil
pitch about mandingos in?
You wouldn't pay no never mind
into three hundred dollar.
But that twelve thousand?
That made you real friendly now, didn'it?
Yes it did.
His wife, uh?
If it had been a snake
we would have beat'em.
Those lyin' goddamn time
wastin' sonsabitches.
Sonsabitches!
.. out of New Orleans, so I had quite
a bit of practice with theaters types.
Oh there you are!
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow ran off together.
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
Lara Lee
I was just lookin' out the big window.
Billy Crash is out there dealin' with some
shady slaver try n' sellin'
a passel of ponys,
would you be a dear and go out
there give them gals an eyeball.
Of course, brother.
Thank you, darling.
Okay. Business never sleeps.
A propos
before your exit, we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.
Ah yes! Yes we would.
And we will again in a moment.
Who is your little friend?
This is Ben
He's a Ol'Joe that
lived around here for a long time.
And I do mean a long damn time.
Well Ben here
took care of my daddy
and my daddy's daddy
till the open kill doe who one day
who been took care o'me.
Growin'up the son of a of a
huge plantation owner in Mississippi
puts a white men in contact with
a whole lot o' black faces.
I spent my whole life here
right here in Candyland
surrounded by black faces.
And seein' them ev'ry day,
day in day out, I
I only had one question.
Why don't they kill us?
Now right up there on that porch
three times a week for fifty years,
Ol'Ben here would shave
my Daddy with a straight razor.
Now if I was Ol'Ben, I would
have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,
and it wouldn't have taken me
no fifty years to do it neither.
But he never did.
Why not?
You see
the science of analogy
is crucial to understandin' the
separation about two species.
In the skull of the African here
the area associated with submissiveness
is larger than any human or any other
sup human species on planet earth.
If you examine
this peace of skull here
you'll notice three distinct dimples.
Here here and here.
Now
If I was holding a skull of a- of a
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,
these three dimples would be found in the
area o'the skull most associated with
creativity.
ut th' th kull f l'n.
And in the skull of Ol'Ben,
unburden by genes,
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with
servility.
Now Bright Boy
I will admit you are pretty clever.
But if I took this hammer here
and I bashed it in your skull
you would have the same three dimples.
in the same place
as Ol'Ben.
Now lay your palms flat on the table top!
If you lift those palms off
that turtle shell table top,
Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with
both barrels of that sawed off!
There have been a latta lies said
around this diner table here tonight,
but that you can believe!
Mr. Moguy,
would you be so kind as to collect the
pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?
Thank you ever so much.
Doctor.
Where were we?
Jackass.
Oh yes
I do believe you were just getting ready
to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
I am right?
Right then.
Bring out Hildi!
Your way, honey.
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!
Lay your hands flat on that table.
And shut your mouth!
Dr. Schultz in Greenville,
you yourself said,
that for the Right Nigger
you'd be willing to pay
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount.
To which, me myself said,
What is your definition of ridiculous?,
to which you said,
Twelve thousand dollars.
Now considering you all have
ridden a whole lotta miles,
went to a whole
lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull,
to purchase this lovely lady right here,
it would appear that Broomhilda
is in fact the Right Nigger!
And if y'all wanna leave
Candyland with Broomhilda
the price is twelve thousand dollars.
And I take it you prefer the take it
or leave it style of negotiating?
Yes I do, doctor.
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw
County, Broomhilda here is my property.
And I can chose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!
And if you all think my price
for this nigger here is too steep,
what I'm gonna desire to do is
take this fuckin' hammer here,
and beat her ass to death with it!
Right in front of both y'all!
Ain't it good, fella?
Then we can examine the three
dimples inside Broomhilda skull!
Now!
What's it gonna be, Doc?
Huh?
What's it gonna be?
May I lift the hands off the table
top in order to remove my billfold?
Yes you may.
That twelve.
Sold!
To the man with the exceptional beard,
and his unexceptional nigger.
Mr. Moguy.
Yes Calvin?
You make this gentleman a receipt
for twelve thousand dollar, please.
Twelve thousand dollar.
Hm.
It was a pleasure doin'
business with ya all.
Now gentlemen
If you care to join me in the parlor
we will be serving white cake.
Well done, Calvin.
Excuse me
Excuse me, madam?
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off that harp!
Doctor!
Doc, you can't go in there!
Hey uh, Steven, hey!
He got no business goin' in there.
Let it be.
He's a little upset, that's all.
I'll handle this.
White cake?
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
You brooding 'bout me
getting the best of ya, uh?
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.
Come again?
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The Three Musketeers.
Yes of course, doctor.
I figured you must be an admirer,
you named your slave after
his novel's lead character.
Now if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,
I wonder what he would have made of it?
You doubt he'd approve?
Yes, his approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.
Soft hearted Frenchy?
Alexandre Dumas is black.
Are these Broomhilda's papers?
Yes they are.
May I?
Of course!
Thank you.
I dealt- her bill of sale of ownership is
written of course a freedom papers, doctor.
Would you have ink and pen for me?
Right over there, on that little table.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Broomhilda Von Shaft
consider yourself a free woman.
Mister Candy
Normally, I would say auf wiedersehen.
But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is till I see you again,
and since I never wish
to see you again, to you sir,
I say good bye.
Let's go.
Com'on.
One more moment, Doctor!
What?
It's a custom here in the South,
once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties
shake hands.
It implies good faith.
I'm not from the South.
But you are
in my house doctor.
so I'm afraid I must insist.
Insist? On what?
That I shake your hand?
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist
in the opposite direction.
You know what I think you are?
What you think I am?
No I don't.
I think you are a bad loser.
And I think you're an abysmal winner.
Never the less
here in Chickasaw County,
a deal ain't done
until the two parties have shook hands.
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit
you don't shake my hand.
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away
twelve thousand dollars?
I don't think so.
Mr. Butch,
if she tries to leave here before
this nigger lovin' German shakes my hand,
you cut her ass down.
You really want me to shake your hand?
I insist.
If you insist.
Aaah Calvin!
Caalvin!
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.
The nigger's going crazy, the hell-
Help, he's blowing everybody- Aaah!
Shit! Son of a bitch!
Get that fuckin'
Get that fuckin'-
Damn sonofabitch, what-
what did the fuckin'- goddammit!
What the-
Don't strike me!
You stupid sonofabitch!
Sorry Jessie!
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun!
Nigger, com'on and kill-
Aah! God! Ah my God, aah!
Motherfucker!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Stop shooting, goddammit!
Django!
What?
We got your woman!
Billy Crash here ha' got
his pistol upside her hair!
You'll stop all that gettin'on,
he don't blow her goddamn brains out.
And that ain't no third holes, boy!
That there is a promise.
Oh oh!
You ain't give up?
Thought you going, uh?
We will kill you!
How shit?!
Honest, ain't lyin', Django,
I swear o' all God.
You give up?
Ain't no harm gonna come t'you.
And I'm supposed to
believe your black ass?
Personal, I ain't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!
I believe, if you don't give up
in the next ten seconds,
we gonna blow this bitch her brains out!
Believe that!
Believe that!
You give me up.
Six!
Just let me go!
Seven!
I take care too much.
Django.
Eight!
I love you.
Nine!
Hold it!
No!
I give up.
I can't hear you, nigger.
I said: I give up!
Hock a litl'e doodle, nigger.
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?
I knew there was
something fishy 'bout y'all.
We found your wanted posters
and book of figures in your saddle bags.
I gotta say
I ain't never heard of no
black bounty hunter before.
A black boy paid to kill white men,
how d'you like that line of work?
Prob'bly pretty good while it lasted, uh?
Time to say goodnight to them nuts, black.
On three
One
I got you.
Two
Calm down nigger, keep calm.
Cap't?
Miss Lara wants to see you.
That is somethin' to do
with the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snippin' Django.
She gonna give 'em to the
LeQuint Dickey people.
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
How disappointing.
You n' me.
These ain't
what you take with you.
Your black ass been all the
motherfuckers' in that Big House
could talk about for the last few hours.
Seemed like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in their life,
was comin' up with all kinds
o'ways to kill your ass.
Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
Now, that may seem like
a good idea, but truth is
when you snip a nigger's nuts,
most of 'em bleed out, know 'bout
seven minutes, most of 'em
More than most.
Then I say is
Hells bells
the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey,
got it worse then that.
And they're still sayin'
Let's whip 'em to death,
Dump 'em to the mandingos,
Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs.
And I say, What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time!
Hells bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that.
Low and behold, out of nowhere,
miss Lara come up with the bright idea
of givin' your ass to the LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of the LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company,
hence forth, till the day you die,
all day, ev'ryday,
you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,
turning big rocks into little rocks.
Now when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,
give you a number, and a sledgehammer,
and say get to work.
One word of says,
they cuts out your tongue,
they's good at that too,
you won't believe that.
Ooh, they does that for you.
They gonna work you, all day,
ev'ry day, till your back give up.
Then they gonna hit you
in the head with the hammer,
tow your ass down
the nigger hole.
And that will be the story end
for you, Django.
Hey, white boy
I said: hey, white boy!
Shut up, black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.
How'd you like to make
eleven thousand dollars?
D'you ain't hear?
I said, how d'you like to make
eleven thousand dollars?
Eleven thousand five hundred, actually.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Back there at that plantation Candyland,
there was an eleven thousand five
hundred dollar fortune,
just sittin' there,
and y'all rode right past it.
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.
I ain't sayin' that, nice thing
'bout this fortune it is.
It ain't illegal,
you can't steal it,
ya gotta earn it, white boy.
You got something to say,
mate, you say it.
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune waiting for you back at Candyland,
is in the form of a wanted
dead or alive bounty
on Smitty Bacall,
and the Bacall Gang.
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murdering gang of stagecoach robbers,
the Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar
wanted dead or alive bounty on him,
one thousand five hundred dollars
for each of his three accomplices.
Dandy Michaels,
Gerald Nash,
Crazy Craig Koons.
Now all four o'them gentlemen,
they're back there at Candyland,
laughin' their ass off.
You know why?
Cause they just got away with murder.
But it ain't got to be that way.
You and your mate, young rabbit
and Yango get that money.
What these jokers do again?
These sonofabitch, they-
they killed innocent people.
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people!
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket if you let me get it.
Get it here.
Wanted dead or alive Smitty Bacall
and the Smitty Bacall gang.
But you're a slave!
I ain't no goddamn slave!
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
- 7000 dollars for Smitty Bacall
This is a shit load!
I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday, as a free man,
I rode in the Candyland,
on a horse, with my German
white partner, Dr. King Schultz.
We tracked the Bacall gang all the way
from Texas, to Chikasaw County.
We finally found their ass
laying low at Candyland.
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot.
Then ev'rybody there decided
to blame me, so here I am.
But Django ain't on that manifest,
and all o'you know I ain't
supposed to be on this trip.
But them four men are still back there,
they're still wanted,
and that eleven thousand
five hundred is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect
is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.
What's the deal?
You tell us who they are
and we turn you lose?
I ain't tellin' who they are.
Look, you give me a pistol,
one o'them horses,
and five hundred dollars of that
eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
This a real handbill.
Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's doesn't
mean that other bunch o'malarky is.
Now why would a slave have a wanted
dead or alive handbill in his pocket?
Ain't that black ridin' into
Candyland yesterday?
Alright
I'm gonna ask you again
I want you to remember I don't like liars.
Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in
with a white man on horse yesterday?
Yeah.
They walked us from
the Greenville Auction and
he rode in on a horse
with a white man.
And this white man
was the black his slave?
He weren't no slave.
You- you fuckin' sure about that?
Damn sure.
What happened over at Candyland?
Bunch of shootin'
master got shot.
Who shot 'em?
The German.
Why did he do that?
The nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers, but they weren't.
Well, what were they?
Bounty hunters.
Fuck me Roy, I mean this-
this could be big, mate!
Well, smoke
you gotta deal.
I got one more condition.
What is that?
When we get there
when the time come
you let me help you kill 'em.
You're a funny bugger!
Get him loose.
Yeah, yeah.
You got yourself a deal, blackie.
You got yourself a deal, mate.
You alright for a black fella!
Oh yeah!
Jeez
There ya go
There ya go, mate.
For you, we'll give you
that pack horse over here.
What's them saddle bags got in?
Dynamite.
I ain't ridin' no horse with no
goddamn dynamite on his back.
I can understand that.
Frankie, we take 'em sticks off that
horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage.
A little dynamite for you
black ass to play with!
Hey Floyd, you got that rifle
on the wagon, don't you?
Yeah, alright.
Don't you give 'em
your gun and gun belt.
Now, don't drop the
fucking thing, alright?
I just had the sights fixed,
and that perfect.
Uh, that's good to know.
Throw me up that dynamite.
Jake!
Yeah?
You gotta try to see what's goin'on
with that goddamn dog!
Go to hell, you motherfucker!
Love you too, son.
It's me, baby.
In the sweet
byin' bye
we will leave
on that beautiful song.
Byin' bye bye bye
we will leave
we will leave byin' bye.
Cora,
would you prepare us some coffee?
Sheba, you help her.
Come on.
In the sweet
byin' bye, ooh
Ya'all gonna be together
with Calvin and the byin bye.
Just a bit sooner
than ya'all was expectin'.
Billy Crash!
Now why would?
Oh, that's right.
Last time I seen you,
you had your hands on my
Django!
You back, sonofabitch!
To dear son, hey Billy.
Oh no!
Now, all o'you black folks, I suggest
you get away from all these white folks.
Not you Steven.
You're right where you belong.
Uh, Cora, before you go
would you tell miss Lara goodbye?
Do- do what now?
I said tell miss Lara goodbye.
Bye miss Lara.
Ya'all two run along now.
Steve!
How you like my new dirt?
You know for an hour, I didn't know
the burgundy was my color.
I count six shots, nigger.
I count two guns, nigger.
You said in 76 years on this plantation,
you seen all o'manner shit done, ain'it?
But I noticed
you didn't knit your knee cap.
Seventy six years, Steven
how many niggers you think
you see come n' go, uh, 7000?
Ev'ry single word that came out of Calvin
Candy's mouth was nothin' but cold shit.
But he was right 'bout one thing.
I am that one nigger in ten thousand.
You sonofabitch!
You motherfucker!
Oh please Jesus, let me kill this nigger!
You ain't go get away with this, Django.
They go n' catch your black ass
You gonna be holdin' out
o'a pole just now, nigger,
the bounty hunters gonna
be looking for you.
You can run, nigger,
but they gonna find your ass!
And when they do, oh I love
what they gonna do to your ass.
They gonna just kill you, nigger!
You the fucked up!
This Candyland, nigger!
You can't destroy Candyland!
We been here long way,
you can't beat Candyland.
Can't no nigger gunfighter get
all the way from don't know where to
Django!
You up on a sonofab-
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Hey Big Trouble Maker.
You know what they are going to call you?
The Fastest Gun in the South.
Let git outta here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you find me sadistic?
You know, I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.
If I wanted to.
You know, kiddo.
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,
to know that there's nothing sadistic
in my actions.
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.
But not you.
No, kiddo.
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.
Bill.
It's your baby.
Coming!
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.
What you gonna do now?
What you got?
I got your ass!
Remember that? Remember?
Okay.
Come on, bitch.
Come on.
Bring it on.
Mommy, I'm home.
Hey, baby.
How was school?
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his little ass
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?
Baby, now,
you can't come in here.
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.
This is an old friend of Mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.
Hi, honey.
I'm...
What's your name?
Her name is Nikki.
Nikki.
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.
How old are you, Nikki?
Nikki... asked you
a question.
I'm 4.
You know,
I had a little girl once.
She'd be about 4 now.
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk
to talk about.
You go in your room.
I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.
Okay?
Nikkia!
In your room.
Now.
You want some coffee?
Yeah. Sure.
This Pasadena homemaker's name
is Jeanne Bell.
Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.
But back when we were acquainted,
four years ago,
her name was Vernita Green.
Her code name was Copperhead.
Mine, Black Mamba.
Do you have a towel?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You still take cream
and sugar, right?
Yeah.
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology?
You suppose correctly.
Look, bitch, I need to know
if you're gonna start any more shit
around my baby girl.
You can relax for now.
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?
That's being more rational
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.
Not rationality.
Look.
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.
You have every right
to want to get even.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
To get even, even Stephen,
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,
then wait for your husband,
the good Dr. Bell, to come home,
and kill him.
That would be even, Vernita.
That'd be about square.
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.
But I can't.
All I can tell you is that
I'm a different person now.
Oh, great.
I don't care.
Be that as it may,
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.
Bitch, you can stop right there.
Just because I have no wish
to murder you
before the eyes of your daughter
does not mean that parading her
in front of me
is gonna inspire sympathy.
You and I have
unfinished business.
And not a goddamn thing
you've done
in the subsequent four years,
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.
So when do we do this?
It all depends.
When do you want to die?
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
How about tonight, bitch?
Splendid.
Where?
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach Little League
about a mile from here.
We meet there around 2.30
in the morning,
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.
And we have us a knife fight.
We won't be bothered.
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw
with an edged weapon.
Fuck you, bitch.
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass,
Black Mamba.
Black Mamba.
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.
Weapon of choice?
If you want to stick with
your butcher knife, that's fine.
Very funny, bitch.
Very funny!
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.
For that, I'm sorry.
But you can take my word for it.
Your mother had it coming.
When you grow up, if you
still feel raw about it...
I'll be waiting.
For those regarded as warriors...
When engaged in combat...
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.
Come on out to Dallas.
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.
And next, we got some record.
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.
Give me a figure.
Nine dead bodies.
And we're talking
the whole shebang.
Bride. Groom.
Reverend.
Reverend's wife.
They even shot that old coloured fella
that plays the organ.
It would appear to me
somebody objected to this union
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.
Good gravy, Marie.
What'd I tell you, Pop?
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.
- You're in a house of worship.
- Sorry, Pop.
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.
Four, maybe five strong.
How can you tell?
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.
This is the work of a salty dog.
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,
all the colours are kept
inside the lines.
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.
Who's the bride?
Don't know.
The name
on the marriage certificate
is Arlene Machiavelli.
That's a fake.
We've been calling her "The Bride"
on account of the dress.
You can tell she was pregnant.
Man would have to be a mad dog
to shoot a goddamn good-Iooking gal
like that in the head.
Look at her.
Hay-coloured hair.
Big eyes.
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.
Son Number One?
Yeah?
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.
I might never have liked you.
Point in fact, I despise you.
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.
Dying in our sleep is a luxury
that our kind
is rarely afforded.
My gift to you.
For fuck's sake.
Hello, Bill.
What's her condition?
Comatose.
Where is she?
I'm standing over her right now.
That's my girl.
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.
What?
We owe her better than that.
Oh, you don't owe her shit!
Will you keep your voice down?
You don't owe her shit!
May I say one thing?
Speak.
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.
But you didn't kill her.
And I put a bullet in her head.
But her heart
just kept on beating.
Now, you saw that yourself
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.
But one thing we won't do
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat
and kill her in her sleep.
And the reason
we won't do that thing
is because that thing
would lower us.
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?
I guess.
Do you really have to guess?
No.
I don't really have to guess.
I know.
Come on home, honey.
Affirmative.
I love you very much.
I love you, too.
Bye-bye.
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?
Word of advice, shithead.
Don't you ever wake up.
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.
Bill, it's your baby.
Oh, my baby.
Four years.
Four years.
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.
You getting your freak on
or what?
Oh, yeah, boy.
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.
Rule number one.
No punching her.
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner
or less some teeth, jig's up.
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.
By the way,
this cunt's a spitter.
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites. No hickeys.
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.
After that,
it's all good, buddy.
Her plumbing down there
don't work.
Feel free to come in her
all you want.
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.
I'll be back in 20.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.
Bon apptit, good buddy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God damn.
You are the best-Iooking girl
I've had today.
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.
Coming in, ready or not.
Hey, buddy, did you have yourself
a good time, man?
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill?
Please stop hitting me.
Where's Bill?
I don't know who Bill is!
Bullshit!
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?
Jane Doe? We don't know
shit about you, do we?
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.
Your name is Buck.
Right?
And you came here to fuck.
Right?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Pussy Wagon."
You fucker.
Texas. Okay.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...
Wiggle your big toe.
I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.
And the dicks responsible.
Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.
When fortune smiles
on something
as violent and ugly as revenge,
it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,
you're doing his will.
At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,
the first name
on my death list,
O- Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.
But when one
manages the difficult task
of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,
one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?
O- Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base
in Tokyo, Japan.
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American army brat
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.
It was at that age
she witnessed
the death of her parents
at the hands
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.
Mommy.
She swore revenge.
Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto
was a paedophile.
At 11, she got her revenge.
Look at me, Matsumoto...
...take a good look at my face.
Look at my eyes.
Look at my mouth.
Do I look familiar?
Do I look like somebody...
you murdered?!
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.
At 25, she did her part
in the killing
of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,
in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.
She should have killed 10.
However, before satisfaction
would be mine,
first things first.
Wiggle your big toe.
Hard part's over.
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?
Okinawa.
One-way.
Hi.
Welcome...
Welcome.
You English?
Almost.
American.
American.
Welcome, American.
Domo.
My English very good.
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?
No, no.
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.
May I sit at the bar?
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.
What other words did you learn?
Oh, just a minute.
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.
I'm watching my soap operas.
Lazy bastard...
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!
The tea's hot.
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?
Shut up!
Get your ass out here!
Excuse me.
What other Japanese do you know?
Oh, let's see.
"Arigato."
"Arigato."
Good!
I already said "domo," right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Konn-itch-iwa."
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."
Konnichi wa.
Please repeat.
Konnichi wa.
Perfect.
Good, good, good.
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.
Now you're making fun of me!
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.
Pronunciation very good.
You say arigato
like we say arigato.
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.
You should learn Japanese.
Very easy.
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.
Most difficult.
But you have Japanese tongue.
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?!
Hurry up... goddammit!
Lazy oaf...
What d'ya want?
I beg your pardon?
Drink.
Oh, yes.
A bottle of warm sake, please.
Warm sake?
Very good!
One warm sake!
Sake? In the middle of the day?
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!
How come I always have to get the sake?
You listen well...
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.
If this were the military,
I'd be General by now!
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,
and you'd still get the sake -
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake!
Do you understand?
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.
Do you understand me?
Sorry.
First time in Japan?
What brings you to Okinawa?
I came to see a man.
Oh, yeah.
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?
Not quite.
Not friend?
I never met him.
Never?
Who is he?
May I ask?
Hattori Hanzo.
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?
I need Japanese steel.
Why do you need Japanese steel?
I have vermin to kill.
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.
Huge.
May I?
You may.
Wait.
Try the second one down.
Funny.
You like samurai swords.
I like baseball.
I wanted to show you these.
However...
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...
I no longer make instruments of death.
What I have here...
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...
...I have retired.
Then give me one of these.
These are not for sale.
I didn't say "sell me."
I said "give me."
Why should I help you?
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.
And considering the student,
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.
You can sleep here.
It will take me a month...
...to make the sword.
I suggest you spend it practicing.
I've completed doing...
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,
to never do again.
I have created "something that kills people."
And in that purpose, I was a success.
I've done this because philosophically,
I am sympathetic to your aim.
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.
If on your journey, you should encounter God...
God will be cut.
Yellow-haired warrior...
Go.
Domo.
It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny
financially
and philosophically in her
Shakespearean-in-magnitude
power struggle
with the other yakuza clans
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.
When the final sword
was sheathed,
it was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse,
the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.
The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,
who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale,
another former protge
of Bill's.
The young girl
in the school-girl uniform
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.
Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,
she makes up for in madness.
Do you like Ferraris?
Ferrari... Italian trash.
Do you want to screw me?
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?
Yes.
How 'bout now, big boy?
Do you still wish to penetrate me...
...or is it I...
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?
See what I mean?
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,
the head general of O-Ren's personal army,
the Crazy 88.
And just in case
you were wondering
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.
The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality
came up before the council
only once.
The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.
The man who seems bound
and determined
to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.
And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...
Boss Tanaka!
What's the meaning of this outburst?
This is a time for celebration!
And what exactly are we celebrating?
The perversion of our illustrious council?
Tanaka, have you gone mad?
I will not tolerate this!
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?
My father...
...along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.
And while...
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...
...they weep in the afterlife...
- Shut up!
...over the perversion committed today!
Outrageous!
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!
Bastard!
Fuck face!
Gentlemen.
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.
By all means, allow him to express it.
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,
...which I love...
...more than my own children,
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!
So that you understand how serious I am...
...I'm going to say this in English.
As your leader, I encourage you
from time to time,
and always in a respectful manner,
to question my logic.
If you're unconvinced
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,
tell me so.
But allow me to convince you.
And I promise you,
right here and now,
no subject will ever be taboo.
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.
The price you pay
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!
I didn't think so.
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.
One ticket to Tokyo, please.
Moshi moshi.
Gogo.
Yeah!
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.
They demand ridiculous things.
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?
What's gonna happen?
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?
You're gonna get your head chopped off.
No, I don't want that.
Yes, it's me.
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.
Who do you remind me of?
Charlie Brown!
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.
Charlie Brown.
Four pepperoni pizzas.
That's not on our menu...
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.
O-Ren Ishii!
You and I have unfinished business!
Charlie Brown, beat it.
Miki.
TEAR THE BITCH APART!
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?
Hi!
Gogo, right?
Bingo.
And you're Black Mamba.
Our reputations precede us.
Don't they?
Gogo, I know you feel
you must protect your mistress.
But I beg you.
Walk away.
You call that begging?
You can beg better than that.
Is that what I think it is?
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.
Silly rabbit.
Trix are for...
Kids.
This is what you get for
fucking around with yakuzas!
Go home to your mother!
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...
...take them with you!
However...
...leave the limbs you've lost.
They belong to me now.
Except you, Sofie!
You stay right where you are.
Your instrument
is quite impressive.
Where was it made?
Okinawa.
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.
YOU LIE!
Swords, however, never get tired.
I hope you've saved your energy.
If you haven't...
...you might not last five minutes.
But as last looks go,
you could do worse.
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.
But you can at least die
like a samurai.
Attack me...
...with everything you have.
For ridiculing you earlier...
...I apologize.
Accepted.
Ready?
Come on.
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.
My Sofie.
I'm so sorry.
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.
No more of that.
But still...
But still nothing.
Except my aching heart
over what she's done
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.
The first reason is information.
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.
But I am gonna ask you questions.
And every time
you don't give me answers,
I'm gonna cut something off.
And I promise you,
they will be things you will miss!
Give me your other arm!
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.
If you had to guess...
What they've been doing.
Why she left you alive...
And where I can find them.
What would be your guess?
Guessing won't be necessary.
She informed me.
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.
As I said before,
I've allowed you to keep your wicked life
for two reasons.
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,
everything that happened
here tonight.
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy
by witnessing
your deformed body.
I want you to tell him all
the information you just told me.
I want him to know what I know.
I want him to know
I want him to know.
And I want them all to know
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.
Revenge is never a straight line.
It's a forest.
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...
to get lost... to forget where you came in.
That woman deserves her revenge.
And we deserve to die.
She must suffer
to her last breath.
How did you find me?
I'm the man.
One more thing, Sofie.
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you find me sadistic?
You know, Kiddo...
I'd like to believe you're
aware enough...
even now...
to know that there's
nothing sadistic...
in my actions.
At this moment...
this is me...
at my most masochistic.
Bill...
it's your baby.
Looked dead...
didn't I?
Well, I wasn't.
But it wasn't from lack of trying.
I can tell you that.
Actually, Bill's last bullet...
put me in a coma.
A coma I was to lie
in for four years.
When I woke up...
I went on...
what the movie...
advertisements refer to ass:
A roaring rampage...
of revenge.
I roared...
and I rampaged...
and I got bloody satisfaction.
I've killed a hell of a lot of
people... To get to this point.
But I have only one more.
The last one.
The one I'm driving
to right now.
The only one left.
And when I arrive at my
destination...
I am going to kill Bill.
Now, the incident that happened at
The Two Pines Wedding Chapel...
that put this whole gory
story into motion...
has since become legend.
"Massacre at Two Pines." That's
what the newspapers called it.
The local TV news called it:
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."
How it happened, who was there...
how many got killed
and who killed them...
changes depending on who's
Telling the story.
In actual fact...
The massacre didn't happen
during a wedding at all.
It was a wedding
rehearsal.
Now, when we come to the part where
I say: "You may kiss the bride"...
you may kiss the bride.
But don't stick your tongue
in her mouth.
This might be funny
to your friends...
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.
We'll try to restrain ourselves,
Reverend.
Y'all got a song?
How about "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.
Sure.
"Love Me Tender" be great.
Rufus, he's the man.
Rufus, who was that you used
to play for?
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.
I was a Drell.
I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster. I was part of
the Gang. I was a Bar-Kay.
If they come through Texas
I played them.
Rufus, he's the man.
Have I forgotten anything?
-Oh, yes, you forgot the seating arrangements.
-Thank you, Mother.
Now, the way we
normally do this...
we have the bride's side
and then we have the groom's side.
But since the bride ain't
got nobody coming...
and the groom's got far too
many people coming.
They're coming all the way
from Oklahoma.
Right.
Well, I don't see no problem...
with the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.
-Do you, Mother?
-No, I don't have a problem with that.
But, honey, you know it would be
good if you had somebody come.
You know, as a sign of good faith.
Well, I don't have anybody...
except for Tommy...
And my friends.
You have no family?
I'm working on changing that.
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the
family this little angel's ever going to need.
I'm not feeling very well and this
bitch is starting to piss me off...
So while you all blather on I'm going
to go outside and get some air.
Reverend, sorry.
She's going to get some air.
Given her delicate condition.
She's just needs a few minutes to
get it together. She'll be okay.
Right.
Hello, Kiddo.
How did you find me?
I'm the man.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing?
Well...
a moment ago,
I was playing my flute.
At this moment...
I'm looking at the most beautiful...
bride these old eyes have
ever seen.
Why are you here?
Last look.
Are you going to be nice?
I've never been nice my whole life.
But I'll do my best
to be sweet.
I always told you...
your sweet side
is your best side.
I guess that's why...
you're the only one who's
ever seen it.
See you got a
bun in the oven.
I'm knocked-up.
Jeez, Louise.
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?
Have you seen Tommy?
Big guy in the tux?
Yes.
Then I saw him. I like his hair.
You promised you'd be nice.
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.
But you're right.
What does your young man
do for a living?
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.
Music lover, eh?
He's fond of music.
Aren't we all.
And what are you doing for
a J-O-B these days?
I work in the record store.
Aso.
It all suddenly seems so clear.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I like it a lot, smart-ass..
I get to listen to music all day...
talk about music all day.
It's really cool.
It's going to be a great environment...
For my little girl to grow up in.
As opposed to jetting around the
world, killing human beings...
and being paid vast sums of money?
Precisely.
Well, my old friend...
to each his own.
However...
all cockblockery aside...
I am looking forward to meeting
your young man.
I happen to be, more or less
particular whom my gal marries.
You want to come to the wedding?
Only if I can sit on the
bride's side.
You'll find it a bit lonely
on my side.
Your side always was
a bit lonely.
But I wouldn't sit
anywhere else.
You know...
I had the loveliest dream about you.
Oh, here's Tommy.
Call me Arlene.
You must be Tommy. Arlene's told
Me so much about you.
-Honey, you okay?
-Oh, I'm fine.
Tommy, I'd like you to meet
my father.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is great.
I'm so glad to meet you, sir.
Oh, Dad.
The name's Bill.
Well, it's great to meet you, Bill.
Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
Surprise.
That's my pop for you.
Always full of surprises.
Well, in the surprise department...
the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.
-When did you get in?
-Just now.
-Did you come straight from Australia?
-Of course.
Daddy, I told Tommy that you
were in Perth mining for silver..
and no one could reach you.
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.
So...
what's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals
but I don't believe I've ever heard...
of a wedding dress
rehearsal before.
We thought...
Why pay so much money for a
dress you're only going to wear once?
Especially when Arlene
looks so goddamn beautiful in it.
So, I think we're going to try to get
All the mileage we can out of it.
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck...
for the groom to see the bride in her
wedding dress before the ceremony?
Well, I guess I just believe in living
dangerously.
I know just what you mean.
Son.
Some of us have places to be.
Sure do.
We got to go through this one
more time.
So, why don't you have...
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away.
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.
I think Father'd be more comfortable
sitting with the rest of the guests.
Really?
That's asking a lot.
Well, forget it. But how about we go
Out to dinner tonight, celebrate.
Only if I pay for everything.
Deal.
We got to do this now.
Can I watch?
Absolutely. Have a seat.
Which is the bride's side?
Right over here.
Mother, here we go.
Now, son, about
them vows.
I just wanted...
You don't owe me a damn thing.
If he's the man you want...
then go stand by him.
Do I look pretty?
Thank you.
Oh, good.
It's all much more sim...
What the hell?!
You're telling me...
she cut her way through 88
bodyguards...
before she got to O-Ren?
No, there wasn't really 88 of them.
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88."
-How come?
-I don't know.
I guess they thought it sounded cool.
Anyhow...
they all fell under
her Hanzo sword.
She's got a Hanzo sword?
He made one for her.
Didn't he swear a blood oath to
Never make another sword?
It would appear he has broken it.
Them Japs sure know how to
Hold a grudge, don't they?
Or maybe...
you just tend to bring that
out in people.
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask it...
but you haven't, by any chance
kept up with your swordplay?
I pawned that years ago.
You hocked a
Hattori Hanzo sword?
It was priceless.
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.
In El Paso,
I got me $250 for it.
I'm a bouncer in a
titty bar, Bill.
If she wants to fight me, she's got
to come to the club, start some shit...
and we'll be in a fight.
I know we haven't spoken
in some time.
And the last time we spoke wasn't
The most pleasant...
but you've got to get over
being mad at me...
and start becoming afraid of...
because she is coming and she's
coming to kill you.
And unless you accept my assistance
I have no doubt she will succeed.
I don't dodge guilt and I don't
Jew out of paying my comeuppance.
Can't we just forget
the past?
That woman deserves
her revenge.
And we deserve to die.
But, then again...
so does she.
So I guess...
we'll just see...
won't we?
Late again.
Budd, can't you tell time?
There ain't nobody in here, man.
Is that Budd?!
Tell him to get his fucking
ass back here!
Budd, Larry'd like a word with you.
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.
You looking for me?
I don't know what car wash you worked
I don't know what car wash
that let you stroll
in 20 minutes late...
but it wasn't owned by me and
I own a fucking car wash.
-Do you want me to leave?
-No, I want you to sit and wait.
Larry...
there ain't nobody out there, so...
There's nobody out there,
Larry.
What's your point?
That you're not needed here?
My point is...
I'm the bouncer...
and there ain't
nobody out there to bounce.
You're saying that the reason...
that you're not doing the job
that I'm paying you to do...
I'm paying you to do
a job to do?
Is that what you're saying?
What are you trying to convince me of?
That you're as useless as an
asshole right here?
Well, guess what, Buddy...
I think you just fucking
convinced me.
Let's go to the calendar.
It's calendar time.
Calendar time for Buddy.
Okay, you working tomorrow?
No, you're not. You don't even
know what fucking day you work.
Here. You're not working tomorrow
you're working Wednesday. There
Working Thursday?
I don't think so.
Friday?
There's your name.
-If you say so.
-There used to be your name.
Saturday...
there used to be your name.
So Monday you're going to...
Here, how about that?
Fucking with your cash is
the only thing you kids seem to...
understand. Okay?
Now, I want you to go home till
I call you. Till I call you.
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.
And...
the hat.
That fucking hat.
That fucking hat.
How many times have I told you...
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?
Well, customers wear hats.
Well, I'm not the boss of the
customers. I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...
that I want you to keep that
shit-kicker hat at home.
Yeah, Budd, honey, the toilet
Is at it again.
There's shitty water all over
the floor.
Okay...
Rocket.
I'll clean it up.
Well that gentled you down
some, didn't it?
Ain't nobody a badass with
a double dose of rock salt...
dug deep in their tits.
Not having...
tits...
as fine...
or as big as yours...
I can't even imagine how bad that
shit must sting.
Yet...
I don't want to neither.
I win..
Bill?
Wrong brother
you hateful bitch.
-Budd.
-Bingo
And to what do I owe this
dubious pleasure?
I just caught me the cowgirl ain't
never been caught.
Did you kill her?
Well, not yet I ain't.
I shot her full
of rock salt.
She's so gentle right now I could...
perform her coup de grace
with a rock.
Anywho...
Guess what I'm holding in my
hand right now.
What?
A brand spanking new
Hattori Hanzo sword.
And I'm here to tell you, Elle...
that's what I call sharp.
How much?
Oh, that's hard to say, being
that it's priceless and all....
What's the terms?
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...
...with a million dollars
in folding cash...
and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.
How do you like the sound of that?
Sounds like we got a deal.
One condition.
What?
She must suffer to
her last breath.
Well that, Elle, darling...
I can pretty much damn well
guarantee.
Then I'll see you in the morning...
millionaire.
All right.
Wakey, wakey.
Eggs and bakey.
I'm done!
Get me out of this hole!
Good.
Who, look at those eyes.
This bitch is furious.
What did I tell you?
Is she the cutest little blond...
pussy you ever saw?
Or is she the cutest little...
blond pussy you ever saw?
I seen better.
You got anything to say?
White women call this
"the silent treatment."
And we let them think
we don't like it.
You grab the feet
I'll get the head.
Wiggle worm. You see this?
You see it, don't you?
That's a can of Mace.
You're going underneath
the ground tonight.
And that's all there is to it.
I want to bury you.
I was going to bury you...
with this.
But if you're going to act like
a horse's ass...
I'm going to spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs!
I'll burn them right out
of your fucking head.
Then you're going to be blind...
and burning...
and buried alive.
Now, what's it going to be, sister?
That's a wise decision.
This is for breaking my
brother's heart.
Once upon a time in China...
some believe...
around the year one double
aught-three...
head priest of the
White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei...
was walking down a road...
contemplating whatever it is...
that a man of Pai Mei's infinite
powers would contemplate...
which is another way of saying
"who knows?"...
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road...
traveling in the opposite direction.
As the monk and the priest
Crossed paths...
Pai Mei...
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity...
gave the monk
the slightest of nods.
The nod was not returned.
Now, was it the intention of the
Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?
The motives of the
monk remain unknown.
What is known...
were the consequences.
The next morning...
Pai Mei appeared at the
Shaolin temple...
and demanded...
of the temple's head abbot that he
offer Pai Mei his neck...
to repay the insult.
The abbot, at first, tried
to console Pai Mei...
only to find Pai Mei was...
inconsolable.
So began...
the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple...
and all 60 of the monks inside...
at the fists of the White Lotus.
And so began the legend...
of Pai Mei's...
Five-Point-Palm...
Exploding-Heart Technique.
Exploding-Heart Technique?
Quite simply...
the deadliest blow in all...
of martial arts.
He hits you with...
his fingertips...
at five different pressure points...
on your body...
and then lets you walk away.
But once you've taken five steps...
your heart explodes...
inside your body...
and you fall to the floor, dead.
Did he teach you that?
He teaches no one...
the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique....
Now...
one of the things I've always...
Liked about you, Kiddo...
is you appear wise beyond
your years.
So allow me to impart a word
to the wise.
Whatever...
Whatever Pai Mei says.
obey.
If you flash him, even for...
an instant defiant eye...
he'll pluck it out.
And if you throw any...
American sass his way...
he'll snap your back and...
your neck like they were twigs.
And that will be the story of you.
He'll accept you as his student.
-What happened to you?
-Nothing.
-Get in a fight?
-Friendly contest.
Why did he accept me?
Because he's a very, very...
very old man.
And like all...
rotten bastards...
when they become old...
they get lonely.
Which has no effect on their
dispositions...
but it does teach them the value...
of company.
Just seeing those steps again...
makes me ache.
You'll have lots of fun...
carrying buckets...
of water up and down that fucker.
When will I see you again?
That's the title...
of my favorite
Soul song of the '70s.
-What?
-Nothing.
When he tells me you're done.
When do you think that might be?
That, my dearest, depends entirely
on you.
Now remember, no sarcasm,
no backtalk.
At least not for the first year or so.
You're going to have to let him
warm up to you.
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans...
and has nothing but contempt
For women.
So in your case, it might
take a little while.
Master...
Your Mandarin is lousy.
It causes my ears discomfort.
You bray like an ass!
You are not to speak
unless spoken to.
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?
I speak Japanese very well...
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...
I asked if you understand Cantonese?
A little.
You are here to learn the
mysteries of Kung fu...
not linguistics.
If you don't get me, I'll communicate
with you like I would a dog...
When I yell, when I point, when
I beat you with my stick.
Bill is your master, is he not?
Yes, he is.
Your master tells me,
you're not entirely unschooled.
What training do you possess?
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style.
And I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for Japanese fat heads!
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe
you are my match?
No.
Are you aware I kill at will?
Yes.
Is it your wish to die?
No.
Then you must be stupid...
Then you must be stupid...so stupid.
Rise, and let me look
at your ridiculous face.
Rise.
So my pathetic friend, Is there
anything that you can do well?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Oh yes, you speak Japanese.
I despise the Goddamn Japs!
Go to that rack.
Remove the sword.
Let's see how good you really are.
If...
you land a single blow...
I'll bow down and call you master.
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.
Your swordsmanship
is amateur at best.
Your so-called kung-fu
is really quite pathetic.
I asked you to demonstrate what you
Know and you did...
Not a goddamn thing!
Let's see your
Tiger Crane...
match my
Eagle's Claw.
Like all Yankee women...
all you can do is order
in restaurants...
and spend a man's
money.
Excruciating, isn't it?
Yes!
If it was my wish...
-I could chop your arm off.
-No, please don't!
It's my arm now.
I can do what I please.
If you can stop me
I suggest you try.
I can't.
Because you're helpless?
Yes.
Have you ever felt this before?
No.
Compared to me, you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?
Yes!!!
That's the beginning!
Is it your wish to possess this
kind of power?
Yes!
Your training will begin
tomorrow.
Since your arm now belongs to me...
I want it strong.
Can you do that?
-I can, but not that close.
-Then you can't do it.
What if your enemy, is three inches
in front of you...
What do you do then...
Curl into a ball...
or do you put your FIST through him?
Now begin.
It's the wood that should fear your
hand not the other way around.
No wonder you can't do it...
you acquiesce to defeat
before you even begin.
If you want to eat like a dog...
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...
pick up those sticks.
Come on, you bitch.
Okay, Pai Mei.
Here I come.
May I have a glass of water, please?
So,
that's a Texas funeral?
I have to give it to you, Budd.
That's a
pretty fucked up way to die.
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?
Paula...
Schultz.
Can I look at the sword?
That's my money right there in that
red bag, isn't it?
It sure is.
Well, then, it's your sword now.
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
What's that you said?
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
That's a Hanzo sword all right.
Bill tells me you once had one of
these had one of the of your own.
Yeah, once.
How does this one compare
to that?
If you're going to compare
a Hanzo sword...
you compare it to every other sword
ever made, wasn't made...
by Hattori Hanzo.
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.
So...
which "R" are you filled with?
What?
They say...
the number one killer of old people...
is retirement.
People got a job to do...
they tend to live a little bit longer
so they can do it.
I've always figured that warriors
and their enemies...
share the same relationship.
So now that you won't have to face your
enemy no more on the
which "R" you filled with?
Relief?
Or regret?
A little bit of both.
Horseshit.
I'm sure you do feel
a little bit of both.
But I know damn well that you feel
one more than you feel the other.
And the question was:
Which one is it?
Regret.
You know, you got to hand it to
the old girl
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.
Bill thought she was so damn smart.
And I tried to tell him, she was just
smart for a blond.
Thanks a bunch.
All right.
I'm sorry, Budd.
That was rude of me, wasn't it?
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.
Black mamba...
this is Budd.
Before I picked that little fella up,
I looked him up on the Internet.
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.
Listen to this:
In Africa, the saying goes:
'In the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you...
and a black mamba can
kill you.
But only with the mamba...
and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time...
is death sure.
Hence its handle,
'Death Incarnate."
Pretty cool, huh?
Its neurotoxic...
venom is one of nature's
most effective poisons...
acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.
The venom of a black mamba can kill
A human being in four hours...
if, say, bitten on the ankle
or the thumb.
However, a bite to the face
or torso...
can bring death from
paralysis within 20 minutes.
Now, you should listen to this,
because this concerns you.
The amount of venom that's delivered
from a single bite
can be gargantuan.
I've always liked
the word "gargantuan."
I rarely have an opportunity
to use it.
If not treated quickly with
antivenom...
ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to
human beings.
However, the black mamba
can deliver...
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of
venom from a single bite.
Now...
in these last agonizing...
minutes
of life you have left...
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.
Right at this moment...
the biggest "R" I feel
is regret.
Regret of leaving...
maybe the greatest
warrior I have ever met...
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhacking...
scrub, alkie, piece of shit
like you.
That woman deserved better.
Bill.
I have some tragic news.
Your brother's dead.
I'm so sorry, baby.
She put a black mamba
in his camper.
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.
Let me put it this way:
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.
Take those flowers to Huntington
Cemetery on Fuller and Guadalupe...
look for the headstone
marked Paula Schultz...
and lay them on the grave.
Because you will be standing
at the final resting place.
of Beatrix Kiddo.
-Marty Kistrosser?
-Here.
-Melanie Harrhouse?
-Here.
-Beatrix Kiddo?
-Here.
Look, I can be there in about four hours.
Do you want me to come over?
No. You need me, baby,
I'm there.
I'm leaving now. You go smoke some pot
or something, I'll be there soon.
Gross.
To my brother, Budd. The only
man I ever loved. Bill.
What's that?
Budd's Hanzo sword.
He said he pawned it.
Guess that makes him a liar
now, don't it?
Elle.
B.
Something I've always
been curious about.
Just between us girls...
what did you say to Pai Mei...
to make
him snatch out your eye?
I called him a
miserable old fool...
Bad idea.
Know what I did?
I killed that miserable
old fool.
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?
I poisoned his
fish heads.
Elle, you treacherous dog.
I give you my word...
And I told him:
To me, the word of an old
fool like you...
is worth...
less than nothing.
That's right.
I killed your master.
And now I'm going to kill you too...
with your own sword, no less.
Which in the very immediate future...
will become my sword.
Bitch...
you don't have a future.
I can't see!
Fucking bitch!
I'll kill you! You're fucking dead!
Fucking dead!!
You bitch! You bitch!
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
I'll get you!
I'm going to kill you!
Where are you?! Let me fucking at you!
Where are you?! Let me fucking at you!
You're fucking dead!
You're dead! I'll kill you,
you fucking...
Shit!
Shit!
Like most men who never
knew their father,
Bill collected
father figures.
The first was Esteban Vihaio.
Esteban was a pimp and a friend of
Bill's mother.
He ran a brothel in Acuna,
Mexico for over 50 years.
His army, the Acuna Boys...
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.
He ran the
Acuna Boys.
Now, at the age of 80...
it would be this retired
gentleman of leisure...
who could point me
in Bill's direction.
Senor Esteban Vihaio?
May I join you?
Only on the condition that you
call me Esteban.
May I join you, Esteban?
Please.
Americana?
I speak a little Spanish,
if you prefer.
I prefer English.
I haven't spoken it in a while, but
I would relish the opportunity...
to converse with such a pretty
companion as yourself.
It's my pleasure...
to be in the company of
such a fine gentleman as yourself.
I must warn you, young lady...
I am susceptible to flattery.
How may I be of service to you?
Where's Bill?
You must be Beatrix.
I can see the attraction.
I remember when Bill was only 5 years
old, I took him to the movies.
It was a movie starring
Lana Turner:
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.
And whenever she would appear
on the screen...
Bill would begin compulsively to suck
his thumb to an obscene amount.
his thumb to an obscene amount.
this boy was a fool
for blonds.
You know...
being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...
is always the right thing to do.
If we had met when
I was back in business...
you would have been my
number one lady.
Well, I'm flattered.
You goddamn well better be.
I heard you were driving
A truck.
My Pussy Wagon
died on me.
The Pussy died.
Bill shot you in
the head, no?
I would have been much nicer.
I would have just cut your face.
You must forgive me.
Please, you have a drink with me.
Clarita.
Coming.
What were we talking about?
Bill.
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill?
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.
I will draw you a map.
Bill is like a son to me.
Do you know why I help you?
Because he would want me to.
Now that I don't believe.
How else is he ever going to
see you again?
Freeze, Mommy.
She got us, B.B.
Mommy got us.
I'm dying.
I'm dying. I'm dy...
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo
know...
that little B.B.
was only playing possum...
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.
I am pervious
to bullets, Mommy.
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.
So as the smirking killer
advanced...
on what she thought was a
bullet-ridden corpse...
that's when little B.B. fired.
You're dead, Mommy. So die.
B.B.
I should've known.
I should've known.
Oh, Mommy, don't die.
I was just playing.
I know.
I told her that you were
asleep...
but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me:
If Mommy's been asleep
since I was born...
then how will she know
what I look like?
To which I replied:
Because Mommy's been
dreaming of you.
That's what I said.
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.
Let me look at you.
My, what a pretty little girl
you are.
You're pretty too, Mommy.
Tell Mommy what you said when
showed you her picture.
Come on, shy girl.
Come on. You know what you said.
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good.
Yeah. Come on.
I said:
You're the most beautifulest
woman I ever saw...
in the whole wide world.
That's the truth.
That's what she said.
B.B...
don't you think Mommy has the...
prettiest hair in the
whole wide world?
Yes, I do.
Matter of fact,
it's better than pretty.
What's better than pretty?
Gorgeous.
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.
You know, sweetie, Mommy's kind
of mad at Daddy.
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.
Want to tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?
I killed him.
Emilio was her goldfish.
Emilio was my goldfish.
She came running
into my room...
holding the fish in her hand and
crying, "Daddy. Daddy. Emilio's dead."
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.
How did he die?"
And what did you say?
I stepped on him.
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were:
I accidentally stepped on him.
To which I queried:
"And just how did your foot...
accidentally find its way
into Emilio's fishbowl?"
And she said, "No. Emilio was on
the carpet when I stepped on him."
The plot thickens.
And just how did Emilio get
on the carpet?
And, Mommy, you would have
been so proud of her.
She didn't lie.
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...
and put him on the carpet.
And what was Emilio doing
on the carpet?
Flapping.
And then you stomped on him.
And when you lifted up your foot...
what was Emilio doing then?
Nothing.
He stopped flapping, didn't he?
She told me later...
that the second she lifted up her
foot and saw Emilio not flapping...
she knew what she had done.
Is that not the perfect visual image
of life and death?
A fish flapping
on the carpet...
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.
So powerful...
even a 4-year-old with
no concept of life or death...
knew what it meant.
You loved Emilio, didn't you?
Well...
I love Mommy too...
But I did to Mommy what
you did to Emilio.
-You stomped on Mommy?
-Worse.
I shot Mommy.
Not pretend shooting like
we were just doing.
I shot her for real.
Why? Did you want to see what would
what would happen?
No, I knew what would happen to
Mommy If I shot her.
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.
What happened?
I was very sad.
And that's when I learned:
Some things, once you do...
they can never be undone.
What happened
to Mommy?
Why don't you ask Mommy?
You okay, Mommy? Did it hurt?
No, sweetie.
Doesn't hurt anymore.
Did it make you sick?
It made me sleep.
That's why I haven't been with you,
B.B. I've been asleep.
But you're awake now, Mommy, right?
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
B.B., would you like Mommy to
watch a video with you...
before sleepy time?
Mommy, do you want to watch a
video with me before sleepy time?
Oh, yeah! I would love to.
-Which one do you want to watch?
-Shogun Assassin.
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin is too long.
No, it's not.
Well, then, I'll leave
you ladies to it.
When I was little...
my father was famous.
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.
And he was the
shogun's decapitator.
He cut off the heads
of 131 lords.
My father would come
home to Mother...
And when he would see her he would
forget about the killings.
He wasn't scared
of the shogun...
but the shogun
was scared of him.
Maybe that was the problem.
One night...
The shogun sent his
ninja spies...
I was just admiring
your sword.
Quite a piece of work.
Speaking of which, how is
Hanzo-san?
He's good.
Has his sushi gotten any better?
You know, I couldn't
believe it.
-You got him to make you a sword.
-It was easy.
I just dropped your name,
Bill.
That'd do it.
I suppose the idea is we
cross Hanzo swords.
Am I right?
Well...
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.
And that private beach...
just so happens to look particularly
beautiful bathed in moonlight.
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.
So, swordfighter...
if you want a swordfight,
that's where I suggest.
But if you want to be old school
about it...
and you know I'm all
about old school then we could wait...
until dawn and slice each other...
up at sunrise like
a couple of real-life, honest...
Now, if you don't settle down,
I'll have to put one in your kneecap...
And I hear tell that's
a very painful...
place to get shot in.
I'm just fucking with you.
Now...
when it comes to you...
and us...
I have a few unanswered
questions.
So...
before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax...
I'm going to ask you some questions
and I want you to tell me the truth.
However, therein lies a dilemma.
Because, when it comes to the
subject of me...
I believe you are truly and
utterly incapable
of telling the truth.
Especially to me.
And least of all to yourself.
And when it comes to the
subject of me...
I am truly and
utterly incapable...
of believing anything
you say.
How do you suppose we
solve this dilemma?
Well it just so happens...
I have a solution.
Gotcha!
Goddamn!
What the fuck did you just
shoot me with?!
My greatest invention.
Or at least
my favorite.
Don't touch it or I'll stick another
one right in your cheek.
What lies within that dart...
just begging to course its way
through your veins...
is an incredibly potent...
infallible truth serum.
I call it
"The Undisputed Truth."
Twice as strong as
sodium pentothal...
with no druggie aftereffects.
Except for a slight wave
of euphoria.
You feel it?
Euphoria?
Too bad.
As you know...
I'm quite keen
on comic books.
Especially the ones
about superheroes.
I find the whole mythology surrounding
superheroes fascinating.
Take my favorite
superhero, Superman.
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.
But the mythology...
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?
About two minutes. Just long enough for
me to finish my point.
Now a staple of the superhero
mythology is...
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne...
Spider-Man is
actually Peter Parker.
When that character wakes up
In the morning, he's Peter Parker.
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.
And it is in...
that characteristic
Superman stands alone.
Superman didn't
become Superman.
Superman was born Superman.
When Superman wakes up in the
morning, he's Superman.
His alter ego
is Clark Kent.
His outfit with
the big red "S"...
that's the blanket...
he was wrapped in as a baby
when the Kents found him.
Those are his clothes.
What Kent wears, the glasses, the
business suit, that's the costume.
That's the costume Superman wears to
blend in with us.
Clark Kent is how
Superman views us.
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?
He's weak...
he's unsure of himself...
he's a coward.
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and
Mrs. Tommy Plympton.
Aso.
The point emerges.
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plympton...
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.
Oh, you can take the needle out.
Are you calling
me a superhero?
I'm calling
you a killer.
A natural Born killer.
You always have been
and you always will be.
Moving to El Paso...
working in a used record store...
going to the movies with Tommy...
clipping coupons.
That's you trying to disguise
yourself as a worker bee.
That's you trying to blend in
with the hive.
But you're
not a worker bee.
You're a renegade
killer bee.
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate...
or how fat your ass got...
nothing in the world would
ever change that.
First question:
Did you really think your life in El
Paso was going to work?
But I would've had B.B.!
Don't get me wrong, I think you
would've been a wonderful mother.
But you are a killer.
All those people you
killed to get to me...
felt damn good, didn't they?
Every single one of them?
Every single
one of them?
Now comes the
$64,000 question.
Why did you run away from me
with my baby?
Do you remember the last assignment
You sent on me.
Of course.
Lisa Wong.
The morning I left,
I was sick.
On the plane, I threw up.
So I started thinking:
Maybe I was pregnant.
Easy to use.
Remove cap and urinate on
the absorbent end for five seconds.
Accurate results in
only 90 seconds.
You can read the results as soon as the
line appears in the window.
Fuck.
What I didn't know...
was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.
With me in L.A.,
it didn't take Li Wong long...
to send an assassin of her own.
Hello, can I help you?
I'm Karen Kim, the hospitality manager.
I have a welcome gift
from management.
That's nice...
Can you leave it by the door?
You pretty good with that shotgun?
Not that I have to be at this range.
But I'm a surgeon with this shotgun.
Well, guess what, bitch.
I'm better than Annie Oakley.
And I got you right in my sight.
I could blow your fucking head off.
Not before I put one right between
your eyes, so let's talk.
Karen...
I just found out...
right now...
not a moment before you
blew a hole through the door...
that I'm pregnant.
What is this?
On the floor by the door...
is a strip that says
I'm pregnant.
Bullshit.
Any other time you'd
be 100 percent right.
This time...
you're 100 percent wrong.
I'm the deadliest woman
in the world.
But right now I'm just scared
shitless for my baby.
Please.
Just look at the strip.
Please.
Stay where you are
and don't move.
I don't know what this shit means.
The box with the directions
is there.
Easy to use.
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end.
Blue means pregnant.
I'll read it myself, thank you.
Say I were to believe you.
What then?
Just go home.
I'll do the same.
Congratulations.
Before that
strip turned blue...
I was a woman,
I was your woman.
I was a killer who killed
for you.
Before that strip turned blue...
I would've jumped a motorcycle
onto a speeding train.
For you.
But once that strip
turned blue...
I could no longer do any
of those things.
Not anymore.
Because I was going
to be a mother.
Can you understand that?
But why didn't you tell
me then instead of now?
Once you knew,
you'd claim her.
Not your
decision to make.
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.
But with you...
she would've been born into a world
she shouldn't have.
I had to choose.
I chose her.
You know, five years ago...
if I had to make a list...
of impossible things
that could never happen...
you performing a coup de grace
on me by busting a cap in my crown...
would've been right at the
top of the list.
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?
I'm sorry.
Was that a question?
Of impossible things that
could never happen..
yes, in this instance you
would've been wrong.
Well?
When you never came back...
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong or
somebody else...
had killed you.
And for the record...
letting somebody think...
somebody they
love is dead when they're not...
is quite cruel.
I mourned you
for three months.
And in the third month of
mourning you...
I tracked you down.
I wasn't trying to track you down.
I was trying to track down the fucking
assholes I thought killed you.
So I find you...
and what do I find?
Not only are
you not dead...
you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.
And you're pregnant.
I overreacted.
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?
I didn't say I would explain myself.
I said I would tell you the truth.
But if that's too cryptic,
let's get literal.
I'm a killer.
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.
And there are consequences...
to breaking the heart of
a murdering bastard.
You experienced some of them.
Was my reaction
really that surprising?
It was.
Could you do what you did?
Of course you could.
But I never thought...
you would or could
do that to me.
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...
but you thought wrong.
You and I have
unfinished business.
Baby...
you ain't kidding.
Pai Mei taught you
the Five-Point-Palm...
Exploding-Heart
Technique?
Course he did.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
Because I'm...
a bad person.
You're not a bad person.
You're a terrific person.
You're my favorite person.
But every once in a while...
you can be a real cunt.
How do I look?
You look ready.
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America
and all the ships at sea.
Let's go to press. Flash.
Do you have a magpie in your home?
If you do, you are most
The magpie is the most charming
bird in all the world.
He's the best friend a
farmer ever had.
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.
And always remember, the magpie
deserves your respect.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.
I ain't got no headache.
Oh, yes, you have, brother.
Mark it.
And, action!
Cut.
Oh, come on, let's do it again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold on, I gotta come up!
I've gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.
We can't be late!
We won't!
Who's... who's holding?
If you 're not, then nobody.
We were kind of hoping you were.
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.
You 're gettin' angry kind of quick,
don't you think?
I was just teasin' you!
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.
Are you through
having a tantrum?
I'm not having a tantrum.
Yes, you are. You've been
in the car all of two seconds,
and you 're already cursing at me.
I am not cursing at you.
You said "Jesus Christ, Shanna,"
and then before
the sentence was over
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your irritatedness.
Come on, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.
And two, we're not really fighting.
Arlene, you've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.
That wasn't a fight.
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.
Oh! Billboard!
So, what's the plan, man?
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?
- Of course.
- You 're so good.
I know.
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?
You bet your ass he is...
with Jesse Letterman.
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.
He's got a big thing for Julia.
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me,
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does.
And on my birthday
he'd give me a fucking phone call.
Oh, billboard!
Yeah, but you get
those legs of yours around him,
and it's all over.
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills that I am also living in,
I'll let you know it worked.
So, margaritas
and Mexican food at Guero's,
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,
and make damn sure they come.
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...
what happened
with you and Nate last night?
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they're never gonna respect you.
Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?
Oh, nothing to write home about.
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing. "
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?
You know, it's everything but.
They call that "the thing"?
I call it "the thing. "
Do guys like "the thing"?
They like it better than "no thing. "
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.
So you 're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?
Correct.
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?
I was straddling him.
What else?
That was it. So we made out
for a little while on the couch...
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave. "
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"
And I said,
"Yup, right now. Let's go. "
And he says, "Wait, what about this?"
And I said no.
He said, "What do you mean?
You don't know what I'm gonna say. "
I said, "I already know what you 're
gonna say, and the answer's no. "
He said, "Well, how can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"
And I said, "Because you 're gonna say,
'Let's just go to sleep together.
'We don't gotta do nothing.
'Just cuddle,
sleep next to each other,
wake up in the morning together. "'
"No. You 're gonna leave...
but I'll see you tomorrow. "
Yeah, fuck Nate.
I mean, he's cute and all,
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.
Remember...
no hookin' up tonight.
You can hang out with them,
you can make out with them,
but no hookin' up with them,
because we are driving
to Lake L.B.J. tonight,
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing...
He said, "I am lettin' you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,
not you and a bunch of horny boys
trying to get their fuck on with my daughter. "
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah.
And it's not like
he ain't gonna know, either,
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear!
But you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang
walking the floor of his lake house,
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.
And if you flirt shamelessly with him,
like the six-foot baby giraffe
in the backseat,
you got a puppy dog for life.
I have my own relationship with Ben,
and you 're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.
You call her dad "Ben"?
I'm not a child.
That's his name.
So, when are the boys
showing up?
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.
Maybe they can bring some pot.
Fuck that. No.
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,
or B, depending on their ass.
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,
we're gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.
Best idea you had all day.
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!
Oh, come on, give me a break.
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.
Okay.
Jules, let me get a drag.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Hey, this is...
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.
Hey.
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.
Ooh...
So, you must be... must be...
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.
Shh!
She don't know nothing about it.
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?
- Soon.
- Tell me what?
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we've gotta tell her sooner than later.
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.
What did you say
and what did you say I'd do?
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,
or Marcy over here,
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.
Okay, so just tell me your way.
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.
Okay, give Marcy your drink.
Okay, so you 're
in a club or a bar,
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,
but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.
Got it.
Okay, Marcy, take it.
Howdy.
Hi, there.
Excuse me, but...
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly," would it?
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.
Barry.
Pleased to meet you, Barry.
Y'all are gettin' me hot!
Shh!
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?
Yes, it is.
And how'd you know
my name, Barry?
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this mornin'.
Oh, you did, did you?
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.
Oh, you do, do you?
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.
She got a black girl's ass.
Well, that's what she always says,
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.
She's got a big ass.
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.
Okay, we'll get to the point,
but for your information,
skinny bitch,
black men and a whole lot
of motherfuckin' white men
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.
If you 're not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
So, Butterfly...
can I buy you a drink?
I'd love one.
What can I get ya?
I'll take a margarita.
Here ya go.
So, after they buy you a drink
when they raise
their glass to toast,
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem...
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep. "
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
"Miles to go before you sleep. "
And then, if they say that...
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.
What?
If they call you "Butterfly,"
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothin'.
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin
thinking you 're a chicken shit.
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be funny!
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.
I said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.
But maybe a little later
in the evening,
you've had a few drinks,
you 're kind of loosey-goosey,
you 're safe with your girls,
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.
She's making me trip.
Shut the fuck up.
You made me trip, dumb bitch!
You fuckin' idiot!
Any dead soldiers here?
Uh, these two. Thank you.
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?
That's a good fucking question.
Lanna-Frank!
Where are you?
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.
Shit! Hold on!
So, where are you?
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.
No. We're not coming over there.
You come over here
like you said you would.
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. I...
No.
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.
We all hate the name "Shauna,"
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna. "
Just remember...
it's "Shanna Banana,"
not "Shauna Banauna. "
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.
- Warren says it, we do it!
I love that philosophy!
"Warren says it, we do it. "
So let's do it!
What is it?
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!
Mmm!
Whoo-hoo!
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?
What the fuck is it?!
Chartreuse.
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?
Not me.
I'm going out for a smoke.
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?
You'll blow up the joint.
Drinks.
What can we get you?
Shanna Banana?
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.
Good boy.
Oh, hey, Punky.
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
- Whoa-ho!
You scared the fuck out of me,
you shitty asshole!
I swear, Arlene.
I was not trying to scare you.
I just... got lucky.
Oh, hardee-fucking-har.
- Let's go inside.
- Wait a minute.
- Why?
- I was thinkin' we could make out.
What, on a porch?
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.
Not in my car it's not.
Look, you won't get wet.
I promise you.
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.
Ha ha ha.
I mean...
you know what I mean.
Look, I know you guys
are going to Lake L.B.J.
and we can't come.
I wanna make out...
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.
I don't want it super fucking obvious
to everybody in the bar we've been gone,
- so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
- Great.
No, no, no.
Deal or no deal?
If you 're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,
we could just walk back
inside the fucking bar right now.
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.
And no begging.
When you say "done," it's done.
I'm gonna remember
you said that.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, you got two jobs... kiss good
and make sure my hair don't get wet.
Now, look, you can't look like
you 're trying to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up,
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.
Yeah, but what's the point?
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,
and it's no guys.
Absolutely no guys.
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.
You think they're gonna fall for that?
We'll be very convincing.
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.
We go to Jger shots.
Man, they're not gonna drink Jger shots.
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,
a fucking bitch
will drink anything.
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jger
down these
fucking bitches' throats.
After that, we'll see if they get
another Jger shot in them.
You never know.
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it. "
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.
My point exactly.
And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana"
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
What's Julia's sweet shot?
- Key Lime Pie.
- Oh, come on, dude.
Even fucking Leroy Brown
would do one more for dessert.
Dude, check it out.
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.
Jesus.
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.
Hi, could I get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace, please?
And where did you two disappear to?
I had to get something
out of the car,
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.
Ah, good for you, Nate.
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?
Who, the dirty hippie?
Meow. She's not a hippie.
She might as well be a hippie.
Thank you, Timmy boy.
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?
What about her?
Hey, Warren!
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.
You've been eavesdropping?
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear. "
I think I belong
in the latter category.
So, uh, Icy Hot.
You 're offering me a ride home?
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.
And when are you
thinking about leaving?
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?
I know looks can be deceiving.
But I'm a teetotaler.
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night,
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.
- Which is what?
- Virgin pia colada.
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink
spend hours at a bar drinking water?
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.
Mmm. Really?
Like what?
Women.
Nacho grande platters.
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,
like Warren here.
Alcohol is just a lubricant
for all the individual
encounters that a barroom offers.
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.
I'm a stuntman.
But that's a very
easy mistake to make.
How do you know my name?
When you were talking with Warren...
couldn't help but overhear.
Fair enough.
So what's your name, Icy?
Stuntman Mike.
Stuntman Mike's your name?
Tsk. You ask anybody.
Hey, Warren.
Who is this guy?
Stuntman Mike.
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?
He's a stuntman.
Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Let's do 'em!
Salud.
Down the snatch.
You know, Pam,
I think it's time for my big drink.
Well, Stuntman Mike,
since I have a tab here,
can I buy you that
virgin pia colada?
Thank you, Pam.
That'd be lovely.
Warren!
A, uh, virgin pia colada
for my stuntman friend
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.
Cabo Wabo, virgin.
- Ah!
- Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.
Mwah.
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?
Hey!
Hey, what's shakin', bacon?
Hey.
It's about fucking time.
Well, beggars can't be choosers.
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.
What?
That table.
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?
Yep.
She sure is a striking-looking woman.
It's got gin, tequila, Jger...
Look at that hair.
Lots of leave-in conditioner.
Is that jealousy I detect?
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,
there's a real easy way to do that.
Really, what would that be?
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she'll find you.
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.
Enjoy it, cocksucker.
You've earned it.
What did she ever do to you?
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.
That's what she did to me.
She was her height right now at 12.
She was a monster.
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?
That pituitary case?
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man...
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.
Hey! Are you
famous or somethin'?
Or somethin'.
No, no, no. Really.
Hey, what do... what do you do?
Really?
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D.J.
Wait a minute.
You've got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?
Yeah.
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.
Yeah.
Jungle Julia Lucai.
Stuntman Mike McKay.
Well.
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.
Would you care for some?
Thank you, Julia,
but just the same...
no thanks.
- Suit yourself.
- But you know...
Oh, shit.
Ah! My God.
Sorry. It's nothing.
What the fuck was that?
You got some voucher here.
I asked him
what movies you worked on.
No fuckin' clue.
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.
I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparral.
a guy falls off a horse,
he says it's him.
You know the show The Virginian?
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,
and I looked like him a bit...
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.
Tsk. Aww, I like it.
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.
And, uh... then that show turned
into The Men of Shiloh.
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vega$.
I was Robert Urich's driving double.
And then Bob
did another show, Gavilan.
and he brought me
with him on that, till...
And after that...
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talkin' about?
Sorry.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
No, no.
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.
How's that?
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?
Stuntman Bob.
I'm ready to blaze!
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.
Anywho, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?
Mm-hmm.
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?
Mmm, us girls.
Good idea.
Ladies?
Thanks.
Cheers, Butterfly.
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...
"And I have promises to keep,
And miles to go
before I sleep. "
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
"Miles to go
before you sleep. "
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...
Mike.
Mike.
She already broke off that dance.
Is that true?
Did I miss my chance?
Do I frighten you?
Is it my scar?
It's your car.
Ah, yeah, I know.
Sorry.
It's my mom's car.
Have you been following us?
No, but that's
what I love about Austin...
it's just so damn small.
- You've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.
So you really weren't following us?
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.
So, how about that lap dance?
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?
I'm good that way.
- Tsk. And you look a little touchd.
- What's "touchd"?
Wounded, slightly.
Why should I be wounded?
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.
So...
How about that lap dance?
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.
Well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,
that rain check'll be worthless.
But that's okay.
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.
You 're still a nice girl.
And I still like you.
But I must warn you of something.
You know how people say,
"You 're okay in my book,"
or, "In my book, that's no good. "
Well, I actually have a book.
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.
And now I've met you,
and you 're goin' in the book.
Except...
I'm afraid I must file you...
under...
"Chicken Shit. "
And what if I did it?
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit,"
then, now, could I?
What's your name again?
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...
I'm Butterfly.
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?
What about "kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,
"hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy
who you could fuck"
did you not understand?
I'm driving.
We're gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.
Ready to go?
Yeah.
- Bye.
Bye.
I think you got Mike laid tonight.
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!
He's just giving me a ride.
Oh, no doubt.
Have a nice ride!
Look, double fucks.
I am not gonna fuck him.
I can hear you.
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.
Bye.
Bye-bye!
Wow, that's fucking scary.
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...
scary tends to impress.
Is it safe?
No, it's better than safe.
It's death-proof.
How do you make a car death-proof?
Well, that's what stuntmen do.
You've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?
Yeah.
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?
CGI?
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you 're right.
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothin' days...
Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,
the White Line Fever days...
real cars smashing into real cars.
Real dumb people driving 'em.
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...
Voila!
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.
Just for the experience.
Why is your passenger seat in a box?
Well, this is a movie car.
Sometimes when you 're shootin' a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car...
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box. "
There you go.
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes. "
But look at the bright side, Pam...
I won't be gettin' fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.
That is a bright side.
I thought so.
Well, Pam...
which way are you going?
- Left or right?
- Right.
Ah, that's too bad.
Why?
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you'd be going left or right.
You see, we're both going left.
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,
and if that was the case,
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.
But since
you 're going the other way,
I'm afraid...
you 're gonna
have to start getting scared...
immediately.
What the fuck?!
Cocksucking motherfucker!
Just fucking let me out of here!
I'll fucking rip your fucking...
Stop the fucking car!
Why are you being such a shit?
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I get it.
I... I know it's a joke,
and super funny.
Um, but if you just stop right now,
you know, and... and let me out,
I'll never tell anybody
because I know it's a joke.
I know all about jokes.
Ha ha ha!
I promise everything'll be fine.
Just... just... just let me out.
Please?
- And... and... and...
- Hey, Pam!
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?
Well, that wasn't a lie.
This car is 100% death proof.
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...
you really need to be sittin' in my seat.
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.
So, you got it?
Thanks, honey.
You 're gonna play it next song, right?
Good boy.
Growl!
Bye-bye.
Who do you want to hear?
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
Who?
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
Who the fuck are they?
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,
he would have ended up in this group,
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.
And if you ask me,
he should have.
That's my boy!
I want to hear
this part of the song louder!
Do you remember anything?
Uh... I... I don't remember.
Doctor Block.
Self-restraints to Room 310.
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?
I don't really see
it's any of your business.
Come on now, Sis.
You just tell us.
How bad is he?
He got banged up real good.
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.
Is that it?
He was real lucky.
That'll be all?
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.
Son of a bitch.
So, Pop.
What do you think?
Well, Son Number One,
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.
Well, give it a shot.
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Not a goddamn thing.
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floatin' on weed,
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatively murdered them gals?
Well, I can't prove it.
But since thinkin' don't cost nothin',
I can think it, and I do.
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn...
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.
Did any of 'em survive?
Shit.
Two tons of metal,
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...
they all princess died.
Why?
Well, I'd guesstimate
it's a sex thing.
The only way I can figure it.
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.
That was just plain old,
goddamn reckless endangerment.
But I got me a goddamn bartender
gonna testify that ol' Stuntman
Mike didn't drink a drop all night.
And his passenger
was left stranded by her date,
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.
Now, on paper, this is gonna look
like he was just trying to help her out.
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.
So, what are you gonna do, Pop?
Tsk.
Well, I could take it
upon myself to work the case,
Search for evidence,
you know, prove my theory.
Alert authorities.
Dog that rotten son of a bitch...
wherever he goes, I go.
Or I could spend the same
goddamn amount of time and energy
following the NASCAR circuit.
Hmm. I've thought about it a lot.
I think I'd have a hell
of a lot happier life if I did the latter.
And just because I can't
punish Old Frankenstein
in there for what he's done,
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John...
if he ever does it again,
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.
Are you on the same floor as him?
No, he's on the fourth.
- And who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.
And so what happened then?
We made out for about ten minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.
- So how's the Rock as a kisser?
- Mm, he's damn good.
He's got them mushy lips,
smooth fingertips.
Mm, I love them mushy lips.
He's a big guy, so he spins me around
so my back is up against him,
takes his big hand
and puts it on my throat,
tilts my head back and leans over me,
kisses me from behind.
Damn, that sounds sexy!
It was sexy.
But then that was it?
You sent him off? How'd he take it?
Wait a minute, what are we doing here?
If I'm gonna power through and pick up
Zo at the airport, I need coffee.
Since you 're getting that, can you get
some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?
We didn't know you were awake.
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.
But get some more vodka
and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.
And some Red Apple Tans.
Damn, I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries.
- You remember how to get to the airport?
Uh-huh.
Then you should get behind the wheel,
'cause you gonna drive.
Motherfuckers.
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.
G.O.
G.O.!
Where the hell are my keys?
Here they are.
Sorry, I didn't mean to give
you a concert there.
No, it wasn't you.
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.
I don't know why,
but that kind of creeped me out.
Little dick.
Clearly.
Since I'm up,
I might as well hit the ATM.
Get me a fuckin' smoke.
What?
Did you just see the...
What?
Nothing, honey.
Y'ello.
It's me.
Miss me?
You best get your ass
off Kim's car.
- I've seen Kim sit on it before.
- Her ass ain't your ass.
Okay. So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.
You got Allure?
Magazines by the window.
Here you are!
You hot mama, you.
See you in a second.
$3.85... out of 20.
And you get 16 and change back.
Thank you very much.
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.
Thought I'd ask.
- Thanks anyway.
- Have a good one.
I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.
This month's?
Listen to this.
The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.
- No way.
- Way!
I can't believe fuckin' Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about per diem here.
We found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.
We're lucky he's not asking
for fuckin' Krugerrands.
I'm getting it, and we're
splitting it three ways.
What, me, you, and Kim?
Kim doesn't give
a shit about Italian Vogue.
but Brandy'll come in with us,
and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.
Okay, but if anybody tears out
any sheets I want,
you gotta make color Xeroxes
of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.
You take it to the art department
and have them do it fuckin' right.
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
Got it!
...the actress...
Oh, boy.
Your timing couldn't be better, Zo.
It just so happens we're all three
off-duty for the next three days.
Fuckin' hell! How does that happen?
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the four days.
So how's the shoot going?
Great. We're having the best time.
The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.
So let's hear it, ladies.
Set romances! Who's getting it off?
That would be Lee and Toolbox.
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.
What's his perversion?
He likes to watch me pee.
Ooh!
Yeah, but not no more.
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.
You had a one-off with the Rock?
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.
He looks like the Rock,
so we all just call him the Rock.
Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.
We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage
and Pee Wee Herman, too.
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.
Who'd you steal him from?
Nobody!
Kim!
- Wha... what?
He totally had a girlfriend.
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.
I did not steal him!
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.
I had a set crush on Cecil.
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!
Oh, it's so funny!
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.
You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.
Oh, well, now you put it like that...
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.
He fucked her on my birthday.
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.
- Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.
What did he get you?
He made me a tape.
He made you a tape?
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?
He made you a tape?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!
Yes, I know what you 're gonna say,
so don't even go there.
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.
How can you not be on my side?
I admit, that sounds bad.
It is bad!
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.
Were you two fucking?
Hell, no.
Hello, is your name Abernathy?
Sorry.
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.
What do you mean "No, of course not"?
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,
you don't become one
of his girlfriends...
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.
I'd be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!
I've let him give me a foot massage,
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.
Bitch, you might be actin'
like you 12 years old,
but he just acting like a man.
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.
Let me get this straight...
you 're not fucking him,
you 're not sucking him,
you 're not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?
Can we just take my sex life
off the table?
Actually, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table...
and your lack of one.
Fuck both of you
and your little high-five.
Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job
in the back of the van
on Tuesday.
I'm not gonna do that!
I know you won't!
But you know who will...
the bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.
I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim's said,
but it is true if you've stretched it out
like you have with Cecil
and you suddenly get dirty on them,
it blows their mind.
So Zo, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.
What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked up.
Cheers to that.
- Word.
Cheers.
So Zo...
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"
So I do.
Then "A little fu -ther!"
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...
...with God knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have broken my neck.
So I am yelling at her:
"Zo, you almost killed me!"
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,
and Zo starts fuckin' around.
And... bam!... if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!
Nice.
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.
I remember taking a step
and looking down,
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about. "
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.
What happened?
What, with Zo, the cat?
Nothing.
If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.
Zo just lands on her feet.
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself...
Zo falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We're laughing about it.
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zo's.
Well, physically speaking,
Zo is amazing.
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zo on that front.
Kim, I like you too.
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zo's prowess,
you 're missing the most
important part of that story.
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zo did.
Zo even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,
and she still fell in.
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.
Hey, I resemble that remark.
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?
Check it out, bitch.
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.
What's a Roscoe?
Roscoe's a pistol.
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.
You have a license to carry?
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.
Oh, I didn't know you were...
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.
Did you know Kim carried a gun?
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.
Do I know? Yes.
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.
Don't do your laundry at midnight.
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.
I wanna shut that nigga down!
How about a knife, at least?
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?
They get shot!
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,
I'll sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.
So Zo, you thought about
what you want to do first?
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.
Oh, really?
And what would that be?
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger...
fuck me swinging, balls out.
Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?
No worries, mate.
I've got it all worked out.
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?
What do you mean by that, mate?
Zo's from New Zealand,
and you never...
I repeat, never...
call a Kiwi an Aussie.
That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.
I'm so sorry. I will nev...
Oh, it's okay.
We're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.
Auckland, to answer your question.
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?
Pipe down and I'll tell you.
I've been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,
looking at cars for sale,
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.
And you wanna buy it?
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?
Oh, uh, Kowalski!
Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!
If I can get this guy
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.
What's Vanishing Point?
What's Vanishing Point?
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.
Actually, Zo, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.
Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.
Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...
Vanishing Point. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.
- Gone in 60 Seconds...
- Oh...
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays Vanishing Point.
Big Wednesday. all the classics.
What do you horny gals want?
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?
Right up here, ladies.
This shit is off the fuckin' hook!
Fuckin' legendary, mate.
Sweet ass. Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to have a word with my associate.
You ladies take your time.
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.
What?
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.
Sorry.
Now, what did you say
after the last time?
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.
- But...
- But, my ass!
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.
Now, did you or did you not say that?
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.
- However...
- Whatever with your "however. "
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it...
Damn skippy you meant it!
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.
You are such a liar!
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I'd ever come to America,
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the Vanishing Point Challenger...
I would have added a "however. "
Right?
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.
I'll be your best friend.
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.
I'll crack your back.
You'll crack it anyway.
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.
Whenever you want it, you've got it.
You don't even have to ask.
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy. "
You crack my back, give me foot massages,
and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.
Deal.
We're gonna see if this guy'll let us
take the car out without him.
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.
What?
- I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let...
- I heard what you said.
I just can't believe
what you said.
You two got some fuckin' balls.
What?
Don't play dumbass with me.
I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road,
but because Zo wanted to drive
some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.
Now you two got the balls to ask me...
no, scratch that... tell me
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?
Bullshit on that.
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.
You 're not gonna
want to do what we're doing.
What, drive a car?
We're doing more than that.
What, drive it fast?
We're doing more than that.
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense
- ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
- How do you know?
'Cause you 're a mum.
Yeah.
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,
so what is it you two daredevils are doing
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.
Besides...
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.
Okay, how about this?
I'll talk him into it,
but I go along.
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.
But don't worry.
He'll say yes.
What are you gonna do, blow him?
No.
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.
That's a good one.
Not really.
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?
Okay, Mama, listen up.
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.
Agreed.
Okay. Go work your magic.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.
Okay, Abbie.
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we're comfortable.
Why would I do something
stupid like that?
To better sell your automobile.
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?
Four reasons, actually.
One, we're not thieves,
two, that would be rude,
three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town...
you can call, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.
Actually, Zo's not, but Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.
Who's Kim? The colored girl?
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.
And reason number four...
and the most important:
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...
Lee.
Why does she look
kind of familiar?
That would be because
she's a famous actress.
Hmm.
Why's she dressed like that?
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.
What's a cheerleader movie?
A movie about cheerleaders.
Is it a porno movie?
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.
Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.
Ta-ta!
Gulp.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I think I'm thinking it.
What are you and you thinking?
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.
I gotta take a...
So, you ready to do this?
You sure?
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.
Kim!
- I'm just saying.
- If you 're gonna take the piss out of it...
I'm just saying.
You wanna start out on top?
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.
Here are your gloves.
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.
This is my jacket.
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.
Give me your belt.
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.
Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.
Come on, give her the belt.
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?
Just 'cause you asked nicely.
It's nice to be nice, Kim!
Whatever.
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You'll ask "pretty please," bitch,
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.
Don't get on my nerves right now.
- I got shit on my mind.
Ooh!
You know, I ain't six.
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?
KIM and ZO: No.
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.
What the fuck are you guys doing?
What does that mean?
Whoa!
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!
That fast enough for your bony ass?
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa ho ho ho!
Oh!
Abernathy, get your ass up here.
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!
Alrighty.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Go, go! Go!
Check it out, bitch.

Whoo-hoo!
Yah hoo hoo!

Watch your feet!
You wanna get hot?
- Fucking son of a bitch!

Then suck on this for a while, bitch!
Zo! Goddamn it!
Oh, my God. Get away from us,

Leave us alone!
Fuck you, motherfucker!

Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?

Whew. That was a close one.
So, where's the maniac?
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.
You wanna go get him?
Oh, hell yeah!
Honey...

Chapter One
Last Stage to Red Rock
Got room for one more?
Who the hell are you,
and what happened to them?
Names Major Marquis Warren former U.S.
Calvary.
Currentrly I'm a
servant of the court.
Tryin' to bringin' a coupla'
no-goods into market.
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket.
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?
I figure that's where you headed, right?
That damblasted blizzards
been on our ass for the last three hours.
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the
way to Red Rock 'fore it catches us.
So ya' hightailin' it
halfway to Minnie's Haberdashery?
You know I am.
- May I come aboard?
- Well smoke...
it up to me, yes.
- But it ain't up to me.
- Who's it up to?
Fella in the wagon.
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company?
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private
trip. And i'm here to tell ya'...
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.
So if you wanna' go to Minnie's with us...
- you gotta' talk to him.
- Well...
that's what i'll do.
Hold it black fella'!
'fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours and
lay 'em on that rock over yonder.
Then you raise both
your hands way above your hat.
Then you approach....
molasses-like.
Real trustin' fella', huh?
Not so much.
Put 'em down.
Come on ahead.
I said way above your hat, god dammit.
Now come forward.
That's far enough.
I'll be dogged,
you black fella' i know.
Col. Something Warren, right?
Major Marquis Warren.
I know you too.
We shared a steak dinner
once upon a time in Chattanooga.
You John Ruth, The Hangman.
That be me.
- How longs that been?
- Since that steak?
Eight months.
So why don't you explain to me...
what an african bounty
hunter's doin' wanderin'
around in the snow in
the middle of Wyoming.
I'm tryin' to get a coupla'
of bounty's to Red Rock.
So you still in business?
You know I am.
What happened to your horse?
Circumstances caused us to take the long
way around. My horse couldn't make it.
You don't know nothin'
about this filly here?
Nope.
Don't even know your name?
Nope.
Well I guess that makes
this one fortuitous wagon.
I sure as hell hope so.
Major Marquis Warren,
this here is Daisy Domergue.
Domergue, to you, this is Maj.
Warren.
Howdy nigger!
She's a pepper, ain't she?
Now girl, don't you know
darkee's don't like bein'
called niggers no more.
They find it offensive.
- I been called worse.
- Now that I can believe.
- Heard of her?
- Should I?
Well she ain't no John Wilkes Booth, but...
maybe you might of heard
tell 'bout the price on her head.
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.
Damn, what she do?
Kill Lily Langtree?
Not quite.
Now that ten thousand's
practically in my pocket.
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides.
Especially to professionals
open for business.
Well I certainly can appreciate that.
I ain't got no designs on her.
One of my fella's over
there is worth four
thousand, one's worth
three, and one's worth one.
That's damn sure good enough for me.
Well...
Let me see their paperwork.
Like I said, molasses-like.
Back off.
Look...
I sure hate to interrupt y'all!
But we gtta' cold damn blizzard,
hot on our asses we tryin'
to beat to shelter!
I realize that!
Now shut your mouth
and hold them damn horses while I think!
Okay boy, we'll give it a try.
But you leave those pistols
over yonder with the driver.
You ain't really gonna'
let that nigger ridin' in
here is ya'? I mean maybe
up there with O.B., but-
How you like the sound
of them bells, bitch?
They are real pretty, ain't they?
You open up your trashy
mouth again, I'll knock
out them front teeth for ya'.
You got it?
Yeah.
Let me hear you say: "I got it."
I got it.
Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin'
these fella's up on the roof.
Give O.B. fifty dollars when
ya' get to Red Rock, and he'll help ya'.
Well, I agree with O.B.
This storm's got me concerned.
We get goin' a lot
quicker you help out too.
Goddamit to hell, I'm
already regretting this!
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's
to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.
And my wrist is gonna'
stay cuffed to hers, and
she ain't never gonna'
leave my goddamn side,
until I personally put her in the
Red Rock jail! Now do you got that?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.
Translation/Timings/Creator by: Deluce
So what happend to your horse?
He got old.
I done had him for a bit.
When the weather took a
turn for the worse, he
done what he could, but
he couldn't make it.
- That's too bad.
- Yes it is.
Me an' ole Lash rode a
lotta' miles together.
You could say he was
my best friend- if I
considered stupid animals
firends, which I don't.
Never the less....
I'm gonna' miss 'em.
Who's Daisy Domergue?
A no damn good murdering
bitch, that's who.
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions
'bout bringing a woman to a rope.
- If by woman, you mean her?
No I do not have mixed emotions.
So you takin' her into Red Rock to hang?
- You bet.
- Gonna' wait to watch it?
You know I am.
I wanna' hear her neck
snap with my own two ears.
You never wait to watch 'em hang?
My bounties never hang,
cause I never bring 'em in alive.
Never?
Never ever.
We talked about this in Chattanooga.
Bringing desperate men in alive,
is a good way to get yourself dead.
Can't catch me sleepin'
if I don't close my eyes.
I don't wanna' work that hard.
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.
No one said
it was suppose to be that hard, nether.
But that little lady,
is why they call him "The Hangman".
When the handbill says
Dead or Alive, the rest of
us shoot ya' in the back
from up on top of a perch
somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle.
But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya',
you don't die by a bullet in the back.
When The Hangman catches you...
you hang.
You overrate 'em nigger.
I'll give you he got guts.
But in the brains department,
he like a man who took a
high dive in a low well.
Now Daisy,
I want us to work out a
signal system of communication.
When I elbow you real hard in the face...
that means: Shut up.
You got it?
I got it.
I...
I know we only met each other once before.
And I don't mean to unduly
imply intimacy. But...
Well...
You still got it?
I still got, what?
The Lincoln letter?
Of course.
Do you got it on you?
Where?
Right here.
Look, I know you gotta'
be real careful with it and all.
I can imagine you probably
don't like to take
it in an'out of the
envelope all that often.
But if you wouldn't mind,
i'd sure appreciate seein' that again.
You right,
I don't like taking it in an'out
of the envelope that much.
- Yeah.
- But...
as your saving my life an' all,
I suppose I could let you read it again.
"Ole Mary Todd's callin',
so I guess it must be time for bed"
Ole Mary Todd.
That gets me.
That gets me too.
You know what this is, tramp?
It's a letter from Lincoln.
It's a letter from Lincoln to him.
They shared a correspondence
during the war.
They was pen pals.
This is just one of the letters.
What the...
O.B.
Stop!
Whoa, easy.
Of all the stupid,
like to rip my goddamn arm off!
I didn't,
drag her stikin' ass up
this goddamn mountain, just
for you to break her neck
on the ouskirts of town.
You the one handed her my goddamn letter.
I didn't give it to her,
I gave it to you!
That nigger like to bust my jaw.
You ruin that letter of his,
that niggers gonna' stomp your
ass to death. And when he do,
I'm gonna sit back on that
wagon wheel watch and laugh.
How is it?
She didn't help it none.
But it's alright.
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?
You... ain't no goddamn... lady!
Hey Mister Ruth?
What?
There's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!
What?
I said, there's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,
whole lotta' fellas walkin' around,
wouldn't you say, Major?
Considerin I'm one half
of them fellas, yeah...
seems to be a lot of 'em.
This changes things, son.
Eight thousand dollars a
lotta' money for a nigger.
But with a partner,
eighteen's a whole lot better.
You really think I'm
in cahoots wit' that fella'? Or her?
- Put them on.
- I ain't wearin' handcuffs.
You put those on or you can stop worryin'
about this whole thing, right now.
Chapter Two Son of a Gun
Hand your weapons to the driver.
Little jumpy, ain't you?
Never mind the jokes, just do it.
- If you say so.
- I do.
Okay...
I done did it.
O.B.?
Ya' got 'em?
- I got 'em!
- Okay fella',
you keep holdin'
that lantern in that one hand,
and you keep that other
hand where I can see it.
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at cha'.
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.
Is that you Chris Mannix?
- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?
- Not quite.
- You know this fella'?
- Only by reputation.
Like I said friend,
you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.
Keepin' you at a disadvantage,
is a advantage I intend to keep.
Whoever you are mister,
you sure sound tough when you're talkin'
to a desperate man knee deep in snow.
I don't want no trouble.
I just wanna' ride.
I'm freezin to death.
Who is this joker.
You heard of the rebel
renegade Erskine Mannix?
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.
The scourge of South
Carolina, Mannix Marauders.
That's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.
What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?
Well Mr. Face,
I was riding to Red Rock and my horse
stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,
fucked up his leg,
an' had to put 'er down.
You got business in Red Rock?
- Yes I do.
- What?
I'm the new sheriff.
- Horseshit.
- 'fraid not.
- Where is your star?
- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.
Once I get there they swear me in,
but that ain't happened yet.
And that's when
you get your star.
You got anything that
can back any of this up?
Yeah.
When we get to Red Rock.
And from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,
I figure you're a bounty hunter
open for business.
And I figure you're taking them three
dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?
Three dead.
One alive.
- Who's that?
- Daisy Domergue.
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.
The Hangman?
Well I'll be double dogged damned.
- You're The Hangman, Bob Ruth.
- It's John.
And you...
your're the nigger with the head...
Major Marquis.
My lord, is that really the real head
of Major Marquis, lookin' at me now?
Yeah it's really me and
it's really my head.
What's goin' on, y'all havin'
a bounty hunters picnic?
Never mind, you takin' in
them three dead bodies
and her to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't ya'?
Yeah.
Well...
the man is red Rock suppose
to pay you is me. The new sherrif.
So if you wanna get paid,
you need to get me to Red Rock.
Well execuse me for findin'
it hard to belive a
town electin' you to do
anything except drop dead.
So I'm suppose to freeze death,
'cause you find something hard to belive?
No I suppose not.
Put them on and come inside.
No.
- Then you'll freeze.
- Then you'll hang.
How so?
Driver!
Could you come down here and join us?
I gotta hold these horses
I can hear you just fine from up here.
You heard me tell this fella'
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?
Yeah.
Red Rock is my town.
And I'm gonna' enter my town
in bounty hunters chains? No Sir!
Sorry bushwackers,
I ain't entering Red Rock that way.
When you finally get to
Red Rock, you're going
to realize every goddamn
thing I said was right.
And I expect you, O.B.,
to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock that John
Ruth, let their new
sheriff freeze to death.
There ain't no bounty
on my head, bushwacker.
You let me die, that's murder.
Hold out your hands.
O.B.
Give the Major back his iron.
One thing I know for sure,
this nigger-hatin'
son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.
Now...
I'll help protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten,
deal?
Ain't love grand. Y'all wanna' lie on
the ground and make snow angels together?
- Tell ya' what, Bob-
- The name's John.
When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you and
Major Marquis there dinner and booze.
- May way of sayin' thanks.
- I don't drink,
with rebel renegades,
and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em.
Well Mr. Ruth,
you sound like you got
a axe to grind against The Cause.
The cause of a renegade army?
A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the
Rebel Flag as an excuse to kill and steal.
And this should interest you Warren,
imparticular emancipated blacks.
Sounds like my kinda' fella'.
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta'
newspapers printed in Washington D.C.
Anywho, I'm just tryin'
to let y'all know grateful I am.
I was a goner, and
y'all saved me.
You wanna' show me how
grateful you are...
shut up!
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.
Here, last piece.
Does he know how famous you once was?
I don't think so.
Black eye.
Do you know who he is?
Do I know about the thirty
thousand dollar reward
the Confederacy put on the
head of Major Marquis?
Yeah.
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,
but they never did
get 'em the right nigger head, did they?
No they didn't.
But it wasn't for lack of tryin'.
Them peckawoods left their homes and their
families, and come to this snowy mountain,
lookin' for me and fortune.
None of them found fortune.
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,
they found me.
Now it didn't stay 30
thousand the length of the war.
Once passions had colled,
it dropped down to eight, then five.
But, I bet even
when it was five thousand,
you had your share
of country boys comin' to call?
You know I did.
Why did they have a reward on you?
The Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing them.
After I broke out of Wellenbeck,
The South took my continued
existence as a personal affront.
So The Cause put a reward on my head.
What's...
Wellenbeck?
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?
No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!
You bust out?
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out.
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea.
So bright...
you got to wonder,
why nobody never thought about it before.
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.
Well the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling.
So I burnt it down.
There was a rookie regiment
spendin' the overnight in that camp.
Forty-seven men...
burnt to a crisp.
Southern youth, farmer's sons,
- cream of the crop-
- And I say, "Let 'em burn".
I'm suppose to apologize
for killin' Johnny Reb?
You joined the war to
keep niggers in chains.
I joined the war to
kill White Southern
Crackers And that means
kill 'em anyway I can.
Shoot 'em. Stab 'em.
Drown 'em. Burn 'em.
Drop a big ole' rock on their head.
Whatever it took to put
White Southern Crackers in the ground
that's what I joined the war to do,
and that's what I did.
To answer your question, John Ruth,
when Major Marquis
burned forty seven men alive,
for no more a reason then to give
a nigger a run for the trees,
that's when The South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.
And I made them trees, Mannix.
And you best belive I ain't look back
till I crossed The Northern Line.
But you had a surprise waitin' for you
on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?
See once they started pullin' out
all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,
seems not all of them boys were Rebs.
You burnt up some of your own boys,
didn't ya' Major?
How many burnt prisoners
they end up findin'?
Wasn't the final Yankee death count
somethin' like thirty-seven?
That's the thing about war Mannix,
people die.
So ya' chalkin' it up to "War Is Hell", ha?
Well admittedly that's a hard argument
to argue with. But if memory serves,
your side didn't look at it that way.
I think they thought,
thirty-seven white men for one nigger
wasn't so hot a trade.
I belive they accused you
of being a kill crazy nigger who
only joined the war to kill white folks
and the whole Blue and Grey
of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.
And that's why they drummed
your black ass outta'
the Cavalry with a yellow
stripe down your back.
Isn't it Major?
Horse shit.
If he did all that, the
Cavalry woulda' shot him.
I didn't say they could prove it.
But they sure did think it out loud,
didn't they Major?
But,
Warren's war record was stellar,
and that's what saved his ass.
Are you killed
yourself your share of
redskins in your day,
didn't ya' Black Major?
Cavalry tends to
look kindly on that.
I'll tell a' what The Cavalry
didn't look kindly on.
Mannix's Marauders that's what.
And the fact that Erskine
Mannix's little boy
would talk about anybody
else's behavior
during war time makes
me wanna horse laugh.
Don't you say anything about my daddy,
what he fought for,
was dignity in defeat,
and against the unconditional surrender.
We weren't foreign barbatians
pounding on the city walls.
We were your brothers.
- We deserved dignity in defeat.
- Just,
how many nigger towns did y'all sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat?
My faire share, Black Major.
'Cuz when niggers are scared,
that's when white folks are safe.
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,
you ride up top wtih O.B.
No no no,
you got me talkin' politics
I didn't wanna'.
Like I said y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.
I...
I think I'll just look out this winda'
let this beatuiful
carriage rock me to sleep.
And dream about how lucky I am.
Chapter Three
Minnie's Haberdashery
Get in there.
Easy.
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?
I can see
you already got another one up in here.
I just got through putting the horses away.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.
Who are you?
I'm Bob.
Well whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.
Come on let's go!
- Open up!
- Kick it open!
- What?
- Kick it open!
Shut that door,
there's a goddamn blizzard out there!
- You gotta' nail it shut!
- You have to nail it shut!
- Hold it shut!
- There's a hammer and nails by the door!
You have to nail it shut!
There's a hammer and nails by the door!
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.
You need to do two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!
- Two pieces of wood.
- That fuckin' thing is busted!
Not just one piece of wood.
- Gimme that other piece of wood.
- Yeah, allright.
- Gimme the nail.
- Here.
Jesus.
That door's a son of a gun.
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella'?
Good heavens,
a woman
out in this white hell.
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.
When did you fella's arrive?
About forty minutes ago.
The Cowboy fella' in the
courner, is that your driver?
No he's a passenger.
The driver lit out. He
said he was going to
spend the blizzard shacked
up with a friend.
Jesus Christ, that's awful!
Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella'
do, soak his ole socks in the pot?
I think we all felt the same way, but were
a little too polite to say something.
- He don't have that problem.
. Where's the well water?
Over there.
So,
all three of you fellas' headed to Red
Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?
Yes, all three of us
were on that stagecouch out there.
Coffybeans?
Over there.
Get your hand outta' there.
The new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with us.
Sheriff of Red Rock,
that'll be the day.
If he is a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.
Good.
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.
So...
the new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with you?
No he's lyin'
he ain't sheriff of nothin'
He's a southern renegade. He's just talkin'
his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.
What the fuck I tell you
about talkin', huh?
I'll bust you in the mouth right in
front of these people, I don't give a fuck!
You never gave your name, sir.
John Ruth.
- Are you a lawman?
- I'm takin' her to the law.
- You're a bounty hunter?
- That's right, Buster.
- Do you have a warrant?
- 'Course I do.
May I see it?
Why?
You're suppose to produce it upon request.
How am I suppose to know,
you're not a villain,
kidnapping this woman
without a warrant in your possession?
What's your name, Buster?
Well...
it certainly isn't Buster.
It's Oswaldo Mobray.
- Oswaldo?
- Yes.
Well...
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.
- I take it you're Daisy Domergue?
- Yeah it's her.
- It says here, Dead or Alive?
- Yeah it does.
Transporting a desperate
hostile prisoner such as her
sounds like hard work.
Wouldn't transporting her be easier
if she were dead?
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.
And why is her hanging proper,
so important to you?
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the
hangman. He's gotta' make a living too.
Well I appreciate that.
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
The Hangman in these parts.
- Looks like I brought you a customer.
- So it would appear.
Have you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers?
No I can't say I have.
Don't talk to my prisoner. I talk to
my prisoner, that's it. You got it?
I got I got. Jolly good.
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?
The Bar is open, follow moi.
All right.
All right.
Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!
I'll feed and water the horses.
You go inside and get some hot coffy.
I've got some stew cooking.
Should be done soon.
Now look...
now matter how bad this blizzard gets,
we still gotta' feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time.
So me an' Chris better lay out a line
from the stable to the front door,
and from the front door to the shithouse.
Okay?
Good idea.
Come on, Chris.
I'll give you a hand.
No no no, go inside, get warm.
You're doing stable work in a goddamn
blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?
You're right, mi amigo.
Muchas gracias.
All right, follow me.
We gonna' drop one,
every ten paces.
- From here to the door.
- Yeah! - All right.
Now, you're wanted for murder.
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.
John Ruth wants to take you back to
Red Rock to stand trail for murder.
And, if...
you're found guilty,
the people of Red Rock will hang you in the
town square. And as the hangman,
I will perform the execution.
And if all those things
end up taking place,
that's what civilized
society calls "justice".
However,
if the relatives and the
loved ones of the person
you murdered were outside
that door right now.
And after busting down that
door, they drug you out
in the snow and hung you
up by the neck, that,
we would be frontier justice.
Now the good part
about frontier justice is
it's very thirst quenching.
The bad part is
it's apt to be Wrong as Right.
Not in your case. In
your case, you'd have it
comin'. But other people,
maybe not so much.
But ultimately what's the
real difference between the two?
The real difference is Me...
The Hangman.
To me, it dosen't matter what you did.
When I hang you, I
will get no satisfaction from your death.
It's my job.
I hang you in red Rock, I move on to the
next town, I hang someone else there.
The man who pulls the lever,
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man.
And that dispassion is
the very essence of
justice. For justice delivered
without dispassion,
is always in danger of not being justice.
Amen.
No offense cowboy fella',
just gettin' your attention.
Yeah, well...
you got it.
What'cha writing firend?
- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.
- What's that?
My life story.
- You're writing your life story?
- You bet I am.
Am I in it?
You just entered.
Well you like writing
stories so much, why don't
you tell me the story
that brings you here?
- Who's askin'?
- I am.
John Ruth. I'm bringin' in
this one to Red Rock to hang.
Ain't no way I'm spendin'
a coupla' nights under a
roof with somebody I don't
know who you they are.
And I don't know who you are.
So...
who are you?
- Joe Gage.
- What?
That's my name, Joe Gage.
Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?
- I ain't goin' to Red Rock.
- Where you goin'?
- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.
- What's there?
My mother.
Your mother?
Listen,
I'm just a cow puncher I just...
I got back from a long drive and...
I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,
I was a partner.
For the first time in my life I,
made a pretty penny and, eh....
Come home and spend time with
my mother for Christmas.
Now that's funny.
'Cuz you don't look like the
coming home for Christmas type.
Yeah, well...
you know, looks
can be deceiving.
Because I definitely am a...
coming home for Christmas to
spend time with mother type.
Christmas with Mother?
I mean...
it's a wonderful thing.
Now is that... good
enough for you?
John Ruth?
For now.
Just steer clear of my prisoner.
Hello old timer.
General.
General.
You sir,
are a Hyena.
And I have no wish to speak to you.
I've been called worse.
Fair enough, General.
Sorry to bother you.
- You gonna' kick it open.
- Kick it open.
It's already cold enough in here.
It dosen't have latch you
gonna' hammer up a board.
You gotta' nail it shut!
- The hammer and nails is by the door.
- There is a hammer and nails right there!
Oh god,
- Holdin' this Chris.
- Here, here.
You need to nail it in!
You need two pieces of wood.
You gotta' hammer another one.
One ain't good enough!
It's gonna' blow right open.
- Goddamn it!
- It's gotta' open if you don't.
- Shut up!
- I got it! Son of a bitch!
Jesis Christ,
that door's a whore!
I get it, haberdashery,
that was a joke.
How's the coffy?
Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.
Thank you.
Guess who he is?
Buffalo Bill?
Hardly, no.
- I'm Oswaldo Mobray, I'm The-
- He's the hangman of Red Rock.
- Oh, you are?
- Yes I am.
Well good to meet you Mr.?
- Mobray.
- Mobray, I'm Chris Mannix,
- the new sheriff in Red Rock.
- Really?
Horseshit!
- Pay no attention to him.
- Horseshit!
Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot
by the stove is a hell of driver named O.B.
That's the only thing you
said that's the truth.
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?
Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?
- In my beg.
- May I see 'em?
- Of course.
Who's Lance Lawson?
He's a fell' been sittin' in the
Red Rock jail about a month now.
He's the fella - who shot the fella' -
who was sheriff 'fore me.
Precisely.
What did she mean when she said,
bounty hunter's nigger
friend in the stable?
He's got a nigger
bounty hunter firend in the stable.
But all that
just to guard her?
I don't think that was
the original idea, but...
that's the idea now.
- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?
- Yeah.
Five of you?
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.
Yes it does.
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?
The Lincoln what?
The letter from Abraham Lincoln?
President Abraham Lincoln?
- Weren't you pen pals?
- With the President?
I'm sorry, I heard somebody
in your party had a
letter from Abraham Lincoln,
I assumed it was you.
Not him!
The black fella' in the stable.
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Yeah.
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Say your name was again?
- Bob.
- Warren.
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?
Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her
mother on the north side of the mountain.
- What?
- Yeah.
- They ain't here?
- Yes, they're visiting her mother.
- Her mother?
- Yes.
I never knew Minnie had a mother.
Everybody's got a mother.
Yeah, I suppose.
- And she left you in charge?
- Si.
That sure don't sound like Minnie.
Are you callin' me a liar?
Not yet, I ain't.
- But it sounds peculiar, though,
- What sound peculiar?
Well first of, Minnie never struck me
as the sentimental type.
Secondly,
I can't imagine Sweet
Dave liftin' his fat ass
outta' his chair long
enough to fetch well water,
unless Minnie was
layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.
Along takin' trips to the north side.
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling
me a liar, mi negro amigo.
Yeah it do sound a whole
lot like, don't it?
But I still haven't done it yet.
Minnie still serve food?
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes. - Then we serve food.
She still stinkin' up the place
with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.
She rolls her own.
"Red Apple Tobacco"
But mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.
Yeah I do, Senor Bob.
Just seein' if you do.
- Fill me up, O.B.
- Yeah.
Goddamn it!
Thank you.
Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty...
is that Genaral Sanford Smithers I see?
You've got a good eye son.
Well, I'll be double dogged damned!
General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!
Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.
- Erskine's boy?
- Yes sir.
May I sit down, Sir?
According to the Yankees,
it's a free country.
Genaral Sandy Smithers...
boy...
oh boy.
Did my daddy talk about you.
I heard you gave those
Blue Bellies sweet hell.
Me and my boys did our part.
Just like Erskine and
his boys did their part.
Hell yeah, we did.
- Yankees sons of bitches?
- I never knew your father, son.
But, I always respected his resolve.
Thank you for saying that, General. Your
respect woulda' meant the world to him.
Can I get ya' some coffy?
- That would be nice.
- Well, how about a blanked?
That would be even nicer.
Hell, you know what,
you can have mine.
Here we go General.
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?
If ya' don't mind me askin'?
My boy.
You gotta' boy that lives in Red Rock?
My son, Chester
Charles Smithers,
he died out here a few years back.
Forgive me sir.
No forgiveness needed, son.
Like I said, it was a few years back.
It was after he served his service.
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,
to make his fortune.
Never to be heard from again.
I bought him a symbolic plot
in the Red Rock cemetery.
I'm here to advise the stone maker
on his headstone.
Was he a goner fer' sure?
No chance he could be livin'
"the cold life" out in
the woods? It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.
If he had done what he came here to do,
he'd a come home.
Close it, close it!
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut!
Really? Who's the idiot
who broke the damn door?
Fucking hold it low.
Okay.
Hold it, mi negro amigo.
We need two pieces of wood.
Ola mi cabron.
There you go, motherfucker!
- That's a lotta' hats, Senor Bob?
- Huh?
Considering Minnie's no
hats indoors policy? Which,
If I remember it correctly,
that was one of them Bar of Iron rules,
kinda rule,
she'd want kept up in her absence.
You seem to have a laissez faire
attitude when it comes to the hats.
I'm guilty.
I have a laissez faire
attitude about the hats.
How about we forget
about the hats today,
considering there's a
blizzard going on and all,
and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?
A large black dog.
Labrador.
You know my daddy,
I said that my daddy!
Always said that Davis
was a courages man.
But he should have put capital
in Montgomery and not Richmond.
Yes, Sir. I agree with that the army in
North Virginia would've been used in a...
I said the army of North Virginia would
have been used in very different way.
Shut up!
O.B.?
Do you know that nigger, Sir?
I don't know that nigger.
But I know he's a nigger.
And that's all I need to know.
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.
- That nigger is-
- General Sanford Smithers?
Battle of Baton Rouge?
Inform the nigger in the
Cavalry officers uniform
that I had a division
of Confederates under my commend,
in Baton Rouge.
Major Nigger, General Smithers wishes me to
inform you... I heard 'em hillbilly.
Inform this old cracker that
I was in Baton Rouge also.
On the other side.
Oh that's interesting.
General Smithers,
he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.
- On the other-
- Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger,
that I don't acknowledge
niggers in Northern uniforms.
You captured a whole
Colored Command that day.
But not one Colored Trooper
made it to a camp, did they?
We had neither the time or the food.
Nor the inclination
to care for Northern horses,
and least of all Northern niggers.
- So we shot 'em where they stood.
- Gentlemen,
Gentlemen,
I know Americans aren't apt
to let a little thing like an unconditional
surrender get in the way of a good war.
But I strongly suggest we don't restage
The Battle of Baton Rouge,
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.
Now, my Nubian friend,
while I realize passions are high,
that was a while ago.
And if you shoot this
un-armed old man I guarantee
I will hang you by the
neck until you are dead.
Once we arrive in Red Rock.
I damn will guarantee that too.
Yeah Warren,
that's the problem with old men.
You can kick 'em down
the stairs and say it's
a accident, but ya'
can't just shoot 'em.
Gentlemen, since we
may be trapped here,
close together like for a few days,
may I suggest a possible solution?
We divide Minnie's in half.
The Northern side
and The Southern Side.
With the dinner table
operating as a neutral territory.
We could say that the
fireplace side of the room,
acts as a symbolic representative of...
Georgia
While the bar, represents...
Philadelphia!
As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?
I help you protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten?
One of them fella's
is not what he says he is.
What is he?
He's in cahoots with this one
that's what he is.
One of them, maybe even two of 'em,
is here to see Domergue goes free.
And to accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everbody in here.
And they got 'em coupla' days.
So all they gotta' do
is sit tight and wait for
a winda' of opportunity.
And that's when they strike,
huh bitch?
If you say so, John.
Are you sure you're not
just being paranoid?
Our best bet is this,
duplicitous fella' ain't
as cool a customer as Daisy here.
He won't have the leather patience
it takes to just sit here and wait.
But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing
it's the right one, isn't so easy.
If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.
He'll try and create his opportunity.
And that's when Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.
And what do you got to say about all this?
What do I got to say?
About John Ruth's ravings?
He's absolutely right.
Me and one of them fella's
is in cahoots. And
we're just waitin' for
everybody go to sleep.
That's when we gonna' kill y'all.
Okay everybody,
hear this.
This here is Daisy Domergue.
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.
Ten thousand dollars.
That money's mine boys.
Don't wanna' share it.
I ain't gonna' lose it.
When the sun comes out, I'm taking
this woman into Red Rock, to hang.
Now...
is there anybody here...
comitted to stopping me`...
from doing that?
Really?
Nobody gotta' problem with this?
Well, I guess that's
very fortunate for me.
However, I hope you
all understand,
I can't just take your word.
Circumstances force
me to, take...
precautions.
When you say precautions...
why do I feel you mean me?
- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.
- You are? - Yes I am.
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?
The Hangman got
himself a gun too?
I'll be dealing with his
gun after I deal with yours.
I feel kinda' naked without it.
Oh, I still got mine.
I'll protect you.
A bastards work is never
done, huh, John Ruth?
That's right, Joe Gage.
- Now gimmie the gun.
- You want it?
You have to come and take-
Calm down.
Take your hand away from your gun.
Blink if you're calm.
- Did he blink?
- He blinked.
Blink if your gonna' remain calm?
- He blinked.
- Take his pistol.
I'm real sorry about this, son.
Like I said, nothing personal.
Just a precaution.
Pretty sneaky.
I'm afraid the same
applies to you too, Mr.
Mobray.
Precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose.
Hand me that little bucket.
O.B.?
Go to the outhouse.
Take this bucket and dump
it down the shit hole.
Why do I gotta' go outside?
Your jacket's already on.
And I sorta kinda trust you.
After you Major.
Okay.
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.
Don't get any ideas,
I ain't goin' soft on ya'.
You lift your ass even
one inch off this seat,
I'll put a bullet right
in your goddamn throat.
So Domergue,
I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke
of luck as far as you're concerned?
- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?
- No I sure don't.
How 'bout you Oswaldo?
How about me what?
Look,
considerin' all the thing I done
for money, I ain't one to judge.
But don't you feel just the least
little bad 'bout hangin' a woman?
Till they invent a trigger
a woman can't pull, if
you're a hang man, you're
going to hang woman.
Well hell Ozzy, I guess I ain't never
looked at it like that before.
When it comes to some
of them mean bastards
out therem it's the only
thing does the job.
You really only need to hang mean bastards.
But mean bastards, you need to hang.
You goddamn son of a bitch!
I almost died out there!
I ain't never going out in that shit
ever, ever again!
You okay, O.B.?
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.
I just need to get warm.
You want some stew, O.B.?
Stew, later.
That's nice.
So...
- how you doin', black Major?
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.
Leave me be from your horseshit.
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln Letter?
I tole' you jackass to
Hee-Haw somewhere else.
That's right, John.
- You did say, didn't ya'?
- Yeah I did.
So...
- you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
- Yes.
Thee Abraham Lincoln?
Yes.
Abraham Lincoln The President
of the United States...
- Yes.
- Of America? - Yes.
- Wrote you a letter, personally?
- Yes.
- Personally? As in: "Dear Maj. Warren"?
- No. Personally as in: "Dear Marquis".
"Dear Marquis" Abraham Lincoln the
President of the United States of America?
Yes.
- May I see it?
- No you may not.
But the way John tells it,
you weren't just some
random nigger soldier picked
from a pile of letters.
Way John tells it,
- y'all hada' correspondence.
- Yes.
Way John tells it, y'all's
practically pen pals?
Yes.
And a pen pal's...
practically a friend.
John Ruth,
you really think a nigger
drummed outta' the
Calvary with a yellow
stripe down his back,
was practically friends with The President
of The United States of America?
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it
to ya' but nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery,
had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,
Least of all, that nigger there.
Was all that horseshit?
Course it was.
Well I guess it's true
what they say about you people.
You can't trust a fuckin' word
that comes outta' your mouth.
What's the matter, John Ruth?
I hurt your feelings?
As a matter of fact, you did.
I know,
I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever
met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.
But you got no idea, what it's like
being a black man facin' down America.
The only time black folks are safe,
is when white folks is disarmed.
And this letter,
had the desired effect of
disarming white folks.
Call it what you want,
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.
You wanna' know why I'd lie
about something like that, white man?
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.
Well I'll tell you like
the lord tole' John,
a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't
have that kinda' effect on me.
- I might let a whore piss on it.
- I spit on it.
Good for you, sister.
Warren goddamit,
you leave that old man alone!
Stand down you son of a bitch,
I shared a battle field with this man.
Or would you deny me that too?
I suppose you were there.
May I join you?
Yes you may.
Damn it.
So,
how's life since the war?
Got both my legs.
Got both my arms.
- I can't complain.
- Got a woman?
Fever took her, started this last winter.
What was her name?
- Betsy.
- Georgia girl?
Augusta.
Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.
I use to raise Kentucky horses.
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit
where I brought of my ponies.
God damnit.
I made good deal on her.
Took the stake he gave and
bought a bunch peach ochards.
Set myself up pretty well.
Did a hellva' lot better than
my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.
Yeah, your son came up
here a few years back.
He spoke highly of his mama too.
You knew my boy?
Yeah...
Yeah I knew 'em.
You did not know my boy.
Suit yourself.
Didja' know my son?
I know the day he died, - do you?
- No.
You wanna know what day that was?
The day he met me.
He came up here to
do a little nigger head huntin'.
By then the reward was so,
five thousand and bragging rights.
But back then to battle hard rebs, five
thousand just to cut off a niggers head,
now that's good money.
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain,
lookin' for fortune.
But there was no fortune to be found.
All they found was me.
All them fella's came up
here sang a different tune,
when they found
themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun,
"Let's just forget it.
I go my way, you go yours"
- that's your boy Chester talkin'
- You a goddamn lie.
"If you just let me
home to my family, I'll
swear, I'll never set
foot in Wyoming again."
That's what they all said.
Beggin' for his life.
Your boy told me his whole life story.
And you was in that story, General.
And when I knew me I had the son.
Of The Bloody Nigger
Killer of Baton Rouge...
- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.
- You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!
General Smithers, don't you listen to him,
he didn't know your boy!
He just heard,
tell why you here is all!
It was cold the day I killed your boy.
And I don't mean snwoy mountain in
Wyoming cold. It was colder than that.
And on that cold day,
with your boy at the
business end of my gun barrel...
I made him strip.
Right down to his bare ass.
Then I told him to start walkin'.
I walked his naked ass for two hours,
'fore his cold collapsed him.
- You never even knew my boy?
- No he didn't!
He's just a sneaky nigger
tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!
Then he commits to begging again.
But this time he wasn't begging to go home.
He knew he'd never see his home again.
And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither.
'Cos he knew that was long gone.
All he wanted... was a blanket.
Now don't judge your boy
too harshly, General. You
ain't never been cold as
your boy was that day.
You'd be surprised what a man that cold,
would do for a blanket.
Wanna know what your boy did?
I took my big, black,
pecker outta' my pants.
And I made him crawl through
the snow on all fours over to it.
Then I grabbed a hand full
of that black hair on the back his head...
Then I stuck my big, black Johnson
right down his goddamn throat.
And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.
And Chester Charles Smithers,
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could.
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?
Your boy...
black dudes dingus in his mouth.
Him shakin', him cryin'
me laughin'
and him not understandin'
But you understand, doncha' Sandy?
I never did give your boy that blanket.
Even after all he did,
and he did everything I asked.
No blanket.
That blanket was just
a heart breakin' liar's promise.
Kinda' like those uniforms
the union issued those colored troopers,
that you chose not to acknowledge.
So what you gonna' do old man?
You gonna' spend the
next two or three days,
ignore the nigger that killed your boy,
Ignoring how I made him suffer?
Ignoring how I made him...
lick, all over my Johnson?
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...
was to let me know...
he was your boy.
Chapter Four
Domergue's Got a Secret
About fifteen minutes has passed,
since we last left our characters.
Joe Gag volunteered
to take Smithers dead body outside.
Straws we drawn to see
who would help him...
O.B. lost.
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo,
had vigorous debate about the legality of
self-defense murder they just transpired.
Marquis Warren who is
supremely confident about the
legality of what just
transpired, ignored them
sat at a table by himself
and drank brandy.
Captain Chris Mannix dawn
the dead Generals coat and
joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.
Hey Ozzy,
hey you got the right idea.
Let's light this place up.
John Ruth held the door close,
waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.
Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot at the community
dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.
John Ruth...
Yeah?
Can I play that guitar over there?
Let's go back a bit.
Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.
Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren shot
General Smithers in front of everybody.
But fourty seconds before
that, something equally
as important happened, but
not everybody saw it.
While Major Warren was
captivating the crowd
with tales of black dicks
and white mouths...
somebody... poisoned the coffy.
He did everything I asked, no blanket.
And the only one to see 'em do it...
was Domergue.
That's why this chapter is called...
Domergue's Got a Secret.
John Ruth.
Yeah.
Can I play that guitar over there?
Yeah.
You come back with anything
else but a guitar.
My pistol plays a tune.
Domergues death march, you got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach, huh?
Yeah.
It's kinda' pretty.
- Got another verse to it?
- Yeah I got.
Go ahead, sing it.
Gimme that guitar!
Music time's over!
Turn around.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!
When you get to hell, John.
Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.
Mannix the coffy!
Oh my god!
Gimme that fucking gun!
Don't test me, bitch.
Everybody get your back sides up
against that back wall over yonder.
Goddamit-
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.
It's up to you.
- I'll get.
- Then get.
You too, Senor Bob.
Everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall.
Move 'em down snowshoes.
Everybody keep your mouth
shut and do like I say.
You open your mouth; you
gonna' get a bullet.
You move a little sudden, a little strange;
you gonna' get a bullet.
Not a warning, not a question;
a bullet.
You got that?
- Let me hear you say, "I got it".
- "I got it".
- "I got it" - "I got it".
- We have it.
Chris Mannix,
come over here on this side.
Come on.
Take this gun out of my holster.
Point it at them.
Like I said, anybody does anything.
And I mean, anything.
Kill 'em.
So...
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth
'bout bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?
I don't know 'bout all that.
But you ain't the killer
who poisoned that coffy.
'cos you almost drunk
it your own damn self.
But one of 'em is.
Gimme the key.
Gimme the key!
You motherfucking black bastard!
You're gonna' die on this mountain
and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!
What I say 'bout talkin?
'Meant it, didn't I?
And you need to understand,
you just killed the only
man here, comitted to gettin'
you to Red Rock alive.
Now, one of y'all...
is workin' with her.
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.
Or all y'all is...
but only one of you poisoned the coffy.
So what charms this bitch got,
take a man brave a blizzard,
kill in cold blood, I'm
sure I don't know.
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,
so you kill him... okay- maybe.
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.
He damn sure would.
But he sure enough led over there
dead now, though, ain't he?
He damn sure is you
sons of bitches.
Just like any one of us
who'd drank that coffy.
Like me god damnit.
Now those of y'all with
your hands on the wall
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.
Think about how that coulda' you
been you rollin' around on this floor.
And about the men standin' next
ta' ya' would be responsible.
And I know who I got my money on. Yeah
that's right Joe Gage I'm lookin' at you.
Not so fast Chris.
We'll get there.
Let's slow it down.
Let's slow it way down.
Who made the coffy?
He did.
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
But it's the stew that's got me thinking.
How long you say Minnie been gone?
A week?
Si.
See, my mama used to make stew.
And it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.
And there was another fellow
on the plantation, Uncle Charly.
He made stew too
and like my mama's.
I ate his stew from the
time I was a whipper,
to I was a full grown man.
And no matter the meat,
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.
Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six
months, so I ain't no expert, but that,
damn sure is Minnie's stew.
So if Minnie's on the north side
visiting her mama for a week,
how'd she make the stew this morning?
And this?
This... is Sweet Dave's chair.
When I sat in it earlier,
I couldn't belive it.
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chaire.
This may be Minnie's place,
but this is damn sure,
Sweet Dave's chair.
And if... he went to
the north side....
I'm pretty goddamn sure
that chair's be going with him.
What's in the chair?
Just what I thought.
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.
So...
are you actually accusing me of murder?
The way I see it, Senior Bob,
whoever's workin' with her,
ain't who they say they is.
And if it's you,
that means Minnie
and her man ain't at her mama's.
They're lyin' out back
there dead somewhere.
Or if it's you Britisch Man,
the real Oswaldo Mobray is lyin'
in a ditch somewhere. And
you're just an English fella'
passin' off his papers.
Or we go by my theory, which
is the ugliest guy did it.
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.
So I take it you've
deduced the coffy was
poisoned while you were
murdering the old man?
Yes.
Well, mi negro amigo,
during that whole incident...
I was sitting on that side of the room.
Playing Silent Night on the piano.
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.
I said you didn't make the stew.
My theory is...
you're working with man
who poisoned the coffy.
And both of y'all murdered Minnie,
and Sweet Dave and whoever
else picked this bad luck
day to visit Minnie's
Haberdashery this morning.
And at some point, y'all intented
to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.
But you didn't count on the blizzard
and you didn't count on the two of us.
That's as far as I got.
How am I doin'?
Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?
So, do you intend to murder me
based on a far fetched nigger theory?
Or can you prove it, cabrone?
It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.
And it's a little bit more then my theory.
How long you say you been
working for Minnie's?
Four months.
If you would have been here
two and half years ago
you'd know about the sign
usta' hang above the bar.
- Minnie mentioned that to you?
- No.
You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed"
Minnie hung that sign up the
day she opened this Habadashery.
And it hung over that
Bar every day till she
took down, a little
over two years ago.
You know why she took it down?
She started lettin' in dogs.
Now Minnie likes just about everybody,
but she sure don't like Mexicans.
So when you tell me, Minnie went
to North side to visit her mama?
Well I find that highly
unlikely... but okay - maybe.
But when you tell me Minnie
Mink took The Habadashery,
the most precious thing to
her in the whole world,
and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I
said: "That sure don't sound like Minnie".
Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.
And if you lyin, which you are,
then you killed Minnie -
and Sweet Dave.
Four measly bulltes and
there goes Senior, Bob.
That still don't get us no closer...
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffy, though.
- Does it Chris?
- No it sure don't.
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy,
to free Daisy.
If I don't hear a
confession from one of you
motherfuckers quick,
fast and in a hurry,
I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy,
down that bitches goddamn throat.
Okay, time's up.
Stop! Alright I did it,
it was me I poisoned the coffy.
I fuckin' knew it!
You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.
Major Warren please let me
sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.
You killed O.B. he's worth ten of you!
Warren can I kill him?
Say adios to your Huevos.
Major Warren?
I ain't got no gun, sheriff.
Chapter Five The Four Passengers
Earlier That Morning.
- Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?
- Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy-
- How many ya' got?
- Full house today, friend.
We got on in there waiting.
Well he's gonna' hafta keep on
waitin' cause we ain't got no room.
Well you need to tell Minnie.
Cause he's been
here two days and Minnie
wants him outta here.
Well I can't give him a seat I don't have -
Listen why don't you take the passengers
inside, introduce them to Minnie.
- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.
- Okay.
Here we are everybody,
Minnie's Haberdashery.
Step outside you and
your friends can stretch
your legs. When you're
reday, stop on inside,
get warm by the fire, get some coffy
in you. I'll introduve you to Minnie.
Hi Minnie!
I'm not trying to tell
you how to run your business.
But I would think coffy
would be the first thing you'd make.
- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.
- Hats!
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.
Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma.
Lovley smile, that Gemma.
Now the fella' in the
uniform I don't know but
the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.
- Hi ya' Dave.
- Hey Judy.
And Minnie, these are the passengers.
Well that's not good enough.
Go take away them rags,
let's see some faces let's hear some names.
Oswaldo Mobray, madame.
Joe Gage.
Bob.
And I'm Jody.
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm
sanctuary in the middle
of such a cold hell.
Well make yourself comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's
by the stove, if that's all right?
Stove, fireplace, whatever.
Just get warm.
Oh, and Judy said something
about the best coffy in the world?
Yes I do belive Judy did say something
about the best coffy in the world.
Well I don't know 'bout all that.
But I'll tell ya what it is.
It's hot and it's strong
and it's good. And
in this snow it sure
'nuff warms your ass up.
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need make it.
And you need to get
your ass out there and
help Charly with them
bags and get Ed in here.
- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.
- I'll fix you!
I don't know some old man.
Well I don't know what I'm
suppose to do about it.
I'm just tellin' you what she said.
Anyway she sent me out here
to help Charly, she wants to talk to you.
Got 'em, Ed.
Miss Minnie?
Would you roll me a cigarette?
Sure honey,
I smoke Red Apple Tobacco, that all right?
It's my favorite.
Don't mind me gentlemen,
I'm just watching.
You play?
You know,
I must of had at least twelve people,
teach me that goddamn game.
Just never could keep the moves in my head.
But if I'm not disturbing,
I like to watch?
Hell no. I like whippin' this
old man's ass in front of a audience,
You ain't whippin' shit.
Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle, Minnie.
- Oh that's real nice, what is that?
- It's french.
- You speak french?
- Oui-
- Oui - what is that mean?
- It means yes.
Oui - Yes.
- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.
- What?
- Ask me if my ass is fat?
- It is.
- I said ask me!
- Why?
- Just do it!
- Is your ass fat?
Oui, look at that y'all
I can speak French.
Are you the jelly bean
salesman around here?
How many peppermint
sticks I get for a nickel?
Five.
All right.
- Here.
- Thank you sugar.
Okay.
Allow me to assist you, madame.
I brought in your bags
in case anybody wants
to change your clothes
before Red Rock.
Peppermint stick?
Thanks.
So why do they call you
Six Horse Judy anyway?
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen
that could drive a six horse team?
Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.
- Could you holding this for me?
- Rock steady, madame. Rock steady.
You gotta' very sweet accent,
where that from, England?
- I take exception to that!
- New Zeeland.
- Carefull, madame.
- Is it anywhere near Old Zealand?
Auckland, what the
fuck is an Auckland?
It's where I'm from,
it's our biggest city.
- Coffy's ready!
- It's about damn time.
- Best coffy on the mountain.
- I'll don't know 'bout all that.
Stagecoach drivers like it. Passengers,
not so much.
Most find it a
mite too strong.
Can't be too strong on
this mountain, thank you.
Well, what'd ya' think?
Shit!
He adds something,
not much, but something.
What do you think, Pete?
Well I must admit, he does make
the set up more convincing.
Do we collect the bodies
and chuck 'em in the well out there?
And then start unhitching the horses
and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed.
Well hang on, by puttin the
horses away that's easy enough.
To drag these fat bastards up and down the
mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.
Look I just started working here.
Whatever Minnie to make y'all mad.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well old man,
if you was a cat what
just happened here
would count as one of your nine lives.
You realize how close you came to being
tossed on a pile of niggers?
- Yes. And when it comes to that pile
of niggers we building out back,
won't take nothin' to make you
General of it. You believe that?
- I expect no less.
- Not so fast old man.
You might have a way out of this yet.
Later today,
dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.
And he's gonna have my sister with him,
and he's gonna have her in chains.
He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.
- You know why?
- No.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's why.
And when he get's here.
I'm gonna' kill that fella'
and turn my sister lose.
Now do you have any reason
why you'd want to interfere
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?
- No.
- You don't.
- No I don't.
- You sure you don't.
I mean we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.
You and Sweet Dave
seemed pretty chummy over here.
I just met these people. I don't give a
damn about them, or you, or your sister,
or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming for that matter.
That is a good answer, old man.
So when they get here,
you just sit your ass in this chair.
And you don't do nothin'.
You don't say nothin'. Hello, thank
you, good night, that's about it.
Maybe your name, but that's it.
Hello, thank you, good night and...
- Maybe your name.
- Maybe my name.
Be an old man, be dotty.
Go to sleep.
And don't you say nothin'
and I mean nothin'
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
When it's safe I kill him,
free my sister and leave you be.
Deal?
Deal, thank you.
During the next four hours, Jody and the
boys chuck the bodies down the well.
Put away the horses.
Tidied around Minnie's.
Stash weapons for further use.
And waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's Stage to arrive.
Here they come.
Okay boys, this is it, get ready!
Let's get ready.
Now remember, it dosen't matter
if we have four men or fory,
we're still gonna' be
facing John Ruth chained
to my sister with a pistol
pointed at her belly.
Now killin' that fella' 'fore he
kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.
But you believe that's
exactly what we're gonna do.
So the name of the game here is patience.
Trapped here for two or three days,
at some point, he will close his eyes
and that's when you
blow the top of his head off.
Remember old man, my sister don't make it
off this mountain alive, neither do you.
I'll do my best.
Good luck, mate.
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?
I can see
you already got another one up in here.
I just got through putting the horses away.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
I can do another one.
And Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob.
Well whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.
Come on let's go!
- Open up!
- You have to kick it open! - What?
Kick it open!
Last Chapter
Black Man, White Hell
How you doin' old boy?
They shot my nuts off they're freezin'
burining up the same time,
bleedin like a stuck pig.
I think I'm gonna die.
And these motherfuckers did it.
That's how I'm doin'.
How you doin'?
Well my leg hurts really bad.
But I think if I'm put all
my weight on my right foot-
I'm just bein' sarcastic
I don't give a fuck about your leg.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Don't worry about my comfort.
Shit! I can't feel my ass no more.
Worry about these owl hoots and that
bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement.
All right!
You!
Fella' in the basement!
You either give up by the
time I count to three,
or I shoot Domergue in the head.
One!... Two!...
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot her!
I'm comin' up!
Hold on there you bushwhacker
sack shooter, you
just open the door we
tell you to come up!
Now throw out your pistol!
Throw it to the bed.
Well he got another.
Now throw out your other pistol.
I ain't got another pistol!
Well you better shit

Cause if you don't throw one up here in the
next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch!
See? told ya'.

How ya' doin' dummy?
Better now I see your ugly face.
How you like you that?
You bushwhacker castrator!
What are you doin' he was giving up?
It took him too long so I done for him.
Joe Gage get your
ass over and shut this trap door.
I'm sorry, honey.
May I sit in the chair?
Yes you may.
Keep your hands flat on that table.
And don't move 'em.
Mannix!
You sure picked the wrong time to turn
into a nigger lover.
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?
You're about to be murdered
in some nigger named
Minnie's house and you
don't even know why!
Okay, bitch...
I'll bite... why?
I am workin with all
three of them fella's...
but not cause they got
butterflies in their belly 'bout me.
But because we're all gang members,
The Jody Domergue Gang!
That fella' y'all just killed in the
basement, was Jody Domergue, my brother!
Well who the hell,
is Jody Domergue?
You wanna tell 'em bounty man?
He's a big bad cat.
He's worth fifty thousand dollars.
And every member of his
gang is wort at least ten.
Wich finally explains why you're worth ten.
And what's gonna' happen
when that sun comes
out nigger, so is my
brother's fifteen men
comin' straight here for us!
Tell 'em Grouch!
Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in Red Rock.
If we couldn't kill John
Ruth and free Daisy here.
Their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth and free Daisy there.
Now with brohter deadd,
I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?
Oh yeah.
And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't
done anything yet, we can't forgive.
So...
- let's make a deal?
- No deals, bitch!
You gonna' let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?
Hold it Warren.
Seein' as she ain't got
nothin' to sell, I'm
kinda curious about her
sales pitch, humor me.
All right, bitch.
What's... your... deal?
Easy.
Take your gun, shoot
that nigger dead.
Then we sit here all nice like
for the next two days.
When the snow melts...
we go back to Mexico and you go on to Red
Rock to get that star pinned on your chest.
Well... we can give 'em Marco.
Bob's real name is
"Marco The Mexican".
He's worth twelve thousand dollars.
- That's "Marco The Mexican"?
- Precisely, yeah.
Sheeit, after I blew his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.
If I die in the next two days, which
is more than likely, you can have me.
Under the name "English Pete
Hicox" I've gotta' federal
bounty of fifteen thousand
dollars on my head.
- And it's all your Chris.
- You keep talkin', Pete.
You gonna talk yourself to death.
Joe Gage, who you be?
- Grouch Douglass.
- You heard of him?
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.
He's worth ten, just like Daisy.
Remind me,
why we wouldn't just kill
all y'all and cash in?
Oh, you can kill us all. But you'll
never spend a cent of that bounty money
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.
Because when that snow
melts, the rest of Jody's
gang - all fifteen of 'em
- that were waiting,
in Red Rock are comin' here.
Now let, let's say you shoot us all...
If you really want all that
Domergue Gang bounty money,
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.
And that ain't gonna' be so easy. Cause I
doubt you can drive a four horse team.
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two horse team.
So that means you're gonna' hafta'
lead a string of horses into Red Rock
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,
you ain't gonna' be able to get away with
any more then let's say one body per horse.
So that's you, leading a string of
four horses into Red Rock,
and with all them horses, in that snow,
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.
And you gonna' run smack
dab into The Domergue
Gang and agin Grouch,
how many is that?
- Fifteen killer strong.
- And when those fifteen killers,
come across you,
in possession of all of
our dead bodies, they
ain't just gonna' kill
you and that nigger.
There gonna go back to Red Rock
and kill every son of a bitch in that town.
You really the Sheriff of Red Rock?
You wanna save the town?
Then shoot that nigger dead!
You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!
Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?
The deal still stands, Chris.
You ain't done we can't forgive.
It's still all on that nigger.
Shoot 'em dead, take my body
and sit out the snow with Daisy and Grou-
Mannix!
Give me my pistol!
Catch 'em here.
Catch 'em here.
So...
you were sayin'...
we sit here...
all nice and friendly like...
for the next two days...
then the snow melts,
you leave here, meet up
with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?
Yeah.
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?
Yeah.
But Jody's worth fifty thousand,
what 'bout his body?
You gonna make a deal with
this diabolical bitch?
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal
with her, we're just talkin'. Calm down.
So what about Jody's body
and the fifty thousand?
You've gotten greedy, Reb, no deal.
We take Jody's body back with us
he got children.
So I kill, Warren...
and we're all friends?
Yeah.
No deal, tramp.
Chris you're makin' the biggest
mistake of your life!
When our boys get here in a coupla' days,
their gonna cut your nuts off!
And there won't be a
stick left in that town unburnt.
Well I guess I should be
plum scared right now, huh?
If you had any brains, you would be.
You see...
here's the problem Daisy.
In order for me to be
scared of your threats,
I got to believe in those fifteen extra
gang members waitin' it out in Red Rock.
And boy, oh boy... I sure don't.
What I belive is...
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass
whatever the fuck his name was....
poisoned the coffy...
and you watched him do it.
And you watched me pork up
and didn't say shit...
and I believe...
you all what you've always been...
a lyin' bitch,
who will do anything...
to cheat that rope waitin'
for her in Red Rock.
Including shittin' out
fifteen extra gang members,
Whenever you needs be.
And...
I believe when it comes to what's left of
The Jody Doe-ming-grey Gang...
I'm lookin' at 'em,
right here right, right
now. Dead on this on this
motherfuckin' floor.
Goddamn right.
You're gonna' die on
this mountain, Chris.
- My brother leds an army of men-
- Horse Shit!
My daddy led an army, he led a
renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause!
My daddy held up to
four hundred men together after the war
with nothing but
their respect in his command.
Your brother's just a owl hoot
who led a gang of killers.
I don't feel so good.
Oh, shit.
You still alive, white boy?
Mannix?
Fuck!
Hey, boy!
Get up!
Chris Mannix!
Your ass ain't nailed to the floor!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up, white boy!
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.
Chris Mannix,
I may have misjudged you.
Now we've come to the part of the story...
- where I blow your goddamn head off!
- No, no, no don't shoot her!
Why the hell not?
John Ruth.
John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.
What's the las thing...
that bastard did, 'fore he died?
Was save your life.
We gonna' die, white boy.
We ain't got no say in that.
But there's one thing left
we do have a say in.
And that how we kill this bitich.
And I say, shootin's to good for her...
John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere,
anytime along the way,
but John Ruth was The Hangman...
and when The Hangman catches ya',
you don't die by no bullet.
When the The Hangman catches ya'...
you hang.
"You only need to hang Mean Bastards."
"But Mean Bastards, you need to hang".
As my first and final act
as the Sheriff of Red Rock,
I sentence you, Domergue,
to hang by the neck until dead.
Hang on, Daisy.
I wanna watch.
Now that, was a nice dance.
That sure was pretty.
Hey...
can I see that Lincoln Letter?
Dear Marquis...
I hope this letter finds you...
in good health and stat...
I'm doing fine...
altough I whish
there were more hours in the day....
is just so much to do...
time's changing slowly...
but surely...
and it's men like you
that will make a difference...
your military success was a credit...
not only to you... but
your race aswell...
I'm very proud
everytime I hear new of you...
we still have a long way to go,
but hand in hand...
I know we'll get there...
I just want to let you know,
you're in my thoughts...
hopefully our paths will
cross in the future...
until then... I
remain your friend...
ole' Mary Todd's calling...
so I guess it must be time for bed...
respectfully... Abraham Lincoln.
Ole' Mary Todd...
That's a nice touch.
Yeah... Thanks.

Happy X-Mas, y'all.

Flight 710, Cabo San Lucas,
now boarding gate 103.
- # Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ##
- First class only.
Buenos dias.
Welcome aboard.
Welcome aboard.
Hi, I'm Sidney. I'm a personal trainer
and Miss Orange County finalist.
- This is my TEC-9.
- That there is a TEC-9.
Little cheap-ass spray gun
made outta South Miami.
It retail for 380,
I get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.
They advertise this TEC-9 as
the most popular gun in American crime.
Can you believe that shit?
It actually says that in the
booklet that comes with it.
"The most popular gun in American
crime". Like they're proud of that shit.
I love my TEC-9.
Let me run this up.
- Design emphasis behind this weapon.
- Check out this gun here.
This here
is a Styer Aug.
Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
Listen.
Ooh! That shit's
expensive too, man.
Made in Austria.
My customers don't know shit about it,
so there ain't no demand for it.
Baby, I really could use me
some more ice.
Hold it. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me tell you,
though, man.
You put this bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want one.
I'm serious
as a heart attack.
When them Hong Kong flicks came out,
every nigger in the world
had to have a.45.
And they ain't want one,
they want two,
'cause all them niggers
want to be the killer.
But what them flicks don't tell you
and what they don't know...
is that a.45 got a serious
fuckin'jammin' problem.
Now, I try to steer my customers
toward a 9 millimeter...
'cause it's damn near
the same weapon and it ain't
got half the jammin' problems.
But you know how them niggers is
out there. You can't tell 'em shit.
They want a.45.
The killer had a.45, they want a.45.
- Thanks, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's your partner?
- Cat named Mr. Walker.
Runs a fishing boat out of Mexico.
I get the merchandise to him,
he gets it out to my customers,
on all my bulk sales anyway.
Before I set that nigger up,
he didn't have a pot to piss in
or a window to throw it out of.
Now that motherfucker
rollin'in cash.
Got hisself a yacht with all kind
ofhigh-tech navigational shit on it.
Oh, uh-uh-uh,
here we go.
AK-47,
the very best there is.
When you absolutely, positively got
to kill every motherfucker in the room,
accept no substitutes.
Nothing gets
between me and my AK.
This here
is the Chinese model.
I get 'em for 850 and double my money.
Grab that for me,
would ya, baby?
You know it's for you.
Girl, don't make me
put my foot in your ass.
The AK-47 is the most
popular assault rifle in the world.
This is the Chinese model. You can tell
by the extra rivets running through...
Hello. It's for you.
Yo, Junebug.
What's up?
Yep. Still hanging with
that stripper Chantelle?
Boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
Thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Well, I'm impressed.
He seems to know a lot.
He's just repeating shit
he overheard.
He ain't any more
of a gun expert than I am.
- You want?
- Sure.
It shoots
9- millimeter Luger
at 1,270 feet per second.
At ten pounds, it's really heavy
for such a small gun.
Demi Moore.
Really reduce muzzle lights
during firing.
I've never held anything
that felt so strong.
So when'd you get out of jail?
Four days ago.
- Where at?
- Susanville.
How long?
About two months shy
of four years.
Four years?
- For what?
- Bank robbery.
Really?
- Ah-iight. Later.
- Shit, I'm impressed.
Ha-ha. See what
I'm talking about?
Now, that was about
a man in New York...
wants a 9-millimeter Smith and Wesson,
model 5946.
And why does
he want it?
'Cause it's the same gun that nigger
on New York Undercover uses.
'Cause of that nigger,
I'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
So...
What's your cost?
Low as two.
- You're serious?
- I'm telling you, Louis.
Start adding these figures up, tell me
this ain't the business to be in.
- Oh, I got me five
M-60 machine guns too.
- Hello.
Motherfuckers come straight
out the Gulf War.
I already sold 3 of them,
- Wow, that's good money.
- I'm gonna make a million
dollars out of this, man.
I already got a half million
sittin' down in Mexico.
When I deliver this next load,
it'll get me another half mil.
- Then what?
- Then I'm out.
Spend the rest
of my life spending.
Pull the trigger and let her rip!
Hi, my name is Melinda.
- Well, you gonna tell me who it is?
- It's Beaumont.
Don't clown on me, bitch.
Beaumont, what's up?
What the fuck
you doin' in jail?
What the fuck
you doin' that for?
Goddamn, nigger.
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drunk driving with a goddamn pistol?
Beaumont.
Beaumont.
Listen to me. Yeah, number one,
you gots to chill.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
'course you're scared.
That's what the motherfuckers get
paid for, to scare the shit out of you.
That's their
motherfucking job.
Thejudge doesn't
give a fuck about that.
He's ready to habitualize you.
Is that what you want?
You wanna look at ten years?
Tomorrow I'll get you out,
I promise, but that means
I gotta pick you up tonight.
Reggie, there ain't
no two ways about it.
You're gonna spend the night in jail,
but I already told you
I'm gonna get you out tomorrow.
- Now, where are you?
You're at your mother's?
Put your mother on.
Miss Gilmore. Miss Gilmore,
this is Max Cherry.
This is Reggie's...
That's right, his bail bondsman.
Look, Reggie
is in big trouble.
I want to pick him up, and I want you
to be responsible for him before l...
Sit down.
Yeah, I'd like you to make sure
that he's there when I get there.
- And look, this is
a second chance for him.
They don't get...
That's correct.
All right. So I'm counting on you
to help me help your son.
Thank you very much.
Put him back on the line, please.
All right, Reggie, we're clear on this.
You got it? Good.
Do yourself a really big favor
and be there when I get there.
How can I help you?
Where can I put my ash?
Use that cup there,
if you like.
Oh, and I need me a bond
for 10,000.
- You all right out there?
- Yeah.
- Have some coffee?
- Go right ahead.
Who's that big,
Mandingo-looking nigger you got
up there on that picture with you?
- That's Winston. He works here.
- Damn!
He's a big 'un, ain't he?
Y'all tight?
- Yeah.
- But you're his boss, though, right?
Yeah.
Bet it was your idea to take
that picture, too, wasn't it?
All right,
you want a $10,000 bond?
- What have you got
to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.
- You have it with you?
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.
- You have cash. What do you need me for?
- Come on, man.
You know how they do.
Black man show up with 10,000 cash,
first thing they wanna know is
where I got it.
Then they gonna want
to keep a big chunk of it,
start talkin' that court-cost shit.
Fuck that noise, Jack.
I go through you.
Cost you a thousand
for the bond.
I can do that.
Who's it for?
A relative?
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.
Started out drunk driving,
but they wrote it up
as possession of a concealed weapon.
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.
They run his name, got a hit.
He been inside.
Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think
they're kind of prejudiced...
against brothers
from down South out here.
If he runs, and I have to go
to Kentucky to bring him back,
you pay the expenses.
You think you can do that?
I've done it.
What's his full name?
Beaumont.
That's all I know.
Would you say that Beaumont
is his first or his last name?
Uh, if I had to guess,
I'd say Beaumont's his Christian name.
Records office.
Hello, this is Max Cherry,
Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this, please?
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hi, Vicki.
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.
Just point it at the car, push the
button, you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh".
- That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.
- Okay.
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- Okay.
Beaumont Livingston.
Livingston, huh?
On his prior, he served nine months.
He's working on four years'probation.
- You don't say.
- You know what he's on probation for?
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered
machine guns.
Damn. Now, they're gonna consider
that a violation ofhis probation?
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.
- Your boy's looking at ten years,
- Mm.
plus the concealed weapon.
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.
O- R-D-E-L-L...
R- O-B-B-l-E.
Compton, 90222.
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.
Who the fuck is this?
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.
Come on up, nigger.
It's open.
My pleasure of living...
demands that I have
a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.
I couldn't go out with a woman
old enough to be my wife.
- O. D!
- Ah-ha-ha!
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- Yeah.
My nigger.
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say. Thank you, thank you.
- Uh-huh. Who was there
for your ass, huh?
- You was there.
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.
That's my motherfucking job.
And I don't mind telling you,
nigger, it's steady work.
Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared
as a motherfucker, O.D.
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.
Three years? Come on, man,
that's a old crime, man.
They ain't got room in the joint
for all these niggers out here
killing people now.
How they gonna
find room for you?
That ain't what
they're telling me.
That's why they call it
"fuckin' with you". Now, let me
tell you how we're going to retaliate.
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick
you up, take you over to Century City,
introduce you
to my lawyer.
Let me tell you
something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.
This nigger
is a junkyard dog.
He my own personal
Johnny Cochran.
Matter of fact,
he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass.
And likeJohnny Cochran,
this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man.
He live to fuck
with the police.
Now, as a favor,
I had him look at your case.
He say you ain't got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' with you.
So we're gonna sic
the junkyard dog on their ass
and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.
- Good lookin' out, man.
Good lookin' out.
- Hmm? Mm-hmm.
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no. Uh-uh.
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.
What you mean?
You know, man,
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favor,
then bam... hit the nigger up
for a favor in return,
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.
- What? What you want?
- I need a favor, nigger.
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.
Uh-huh.
And why are you home, huh?
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?
I need some help,
and you can help me out.
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.
Come on.
I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
There ain't no problem.
It's more like
a situation.
You remember them three
M-60 machine guns I sold
last year outta the five I got?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell
the other two tonight.
There's this group of Koreans
over in Koreatown startin' this
little Neighborhood Watch thing.
They need some weapons so they
can show the neighborhood niggers
they mean business.
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.
They don't want no trouble.
You might argue with them
about price and shit,
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back.
But I got me a rule:
Never do business with people
you ain't never done business
with before without backup.
That's why I need you.
Backup.
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody.
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.
You must be out of your mind
if you think I'm gonna get
in this dirty-ass trunk.
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Koreatown, man.
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.
I ain't ridin' in
no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.
I got a problem
with small places.
I got a problem with spending
$10,000 on ungrateful niggers
to get them out of jail,
but I did it.
How small was that
jail cell, motherfucker?
- I know I owe you,
you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk.
I want to help you, but I won't be
locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.
You think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass, huh?
- I know you helped me out.
- Do you think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass?
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't,
but look, in the trunk?
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did.
Now, look, man, all I'm asking
you to do is get in the trunk,
hold this fuckin' shotgun,
point it at these Buddha-heads
when I open it, all right?
- You're catching a nigger
off-guard with this shit.
- Look here. I tell you what.
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans,
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.
Think about it now.
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions,
side of red beans and rice,
some greens.
That's some good eatin'.
Man.
Exactly how long do I gotta
be in this motherfucker?
Hey, you said ten minutes.
Hey, motherfucker, you like
to hit my goddamn head!
You ponytail-wearing
motherfucker.
What the hell's wrong
with you?
#Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you #
#Red magic satin
playin'near #
# Too #
#All through the morning rain
I gazed #
# The sun doesn't shine #
#Rainfalls and waterfalls
run through my mind #
#In the garden I see #
# Washed purple
shower bells and tea #
# One early bitter cousin
Misty green #
#Pretty music I hear #
#So happy in mind #
Do a nigger a favor...
# Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh #
# Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh #
# Ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh ##
# Ooh, ooh #
# Ooh, ooh #
# Baby love
my baby love #
# I need you
Oh, how I need you #
# But all you do
is treat me bad #
# Break my heart

#Tell me

#To make you

# 'Cause baby love

# In my arms, why don't you stay #
- Hello.
- # Need ya, need ya #
- Hello, baby.
- #Baby love #
Well, you know, I'm just doin'
that thing I do, baby.
Oh, no. Okay.
Hold on.
Uh, Louis, baby. It's Ordell.
Oh, I'm just
gonna go pee.
#Separate, my love #
#All of my
whole life through #
- #I never loved no one but you ##
- Hello.
Louis, my man.
What ya doin'?
Okay. Okay.
I'm just hanging out with Simone.
Oh, yeah?
She doin' that show for you?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
I can hear the Supremes in
the background. She ain't bad, is she?
- No, she's pretty good.
- She do Mary Wells for you yet?
Nah, I don't know
the names of everybody,
but she's done a whole bunch of them.
Uh-huh.
Well, guess where I am?
I don't know.
I'm in the cozy confines
of an Oldsmobile...
parked right outside
Simone's house.
- Oh, you're outside?
- Yeah.
- Come on in.
- Ah, no, man.
I already caught that show.
I got some for-your-eyes-only shit
to show you. Why don't you step outside?
- Who was that?
- That's Beaumont.
Who's Beaumont?
A employee
I had to let go.
What'd he do?
He put hisself in a position
where he was gonna have to
do ten years in prison.
That's what he did.
And if you
know Beaumont,
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years.
If you know that,
then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can...
to keep from doin'
them ten years,
includin' tellin' the federal government
any and every motherfucking thing...
about my black ass.
Now, that, my friend,
is a clear-cut case...
of him or me,
and you best believe...
it ain't gonna be me.
Now, Louis,
if you gonna come in
on this thing with me,
you've got to
be prepared...
to go all the way.
Now, I got me, so far,
a half million dollars in lock boxes...
in a bank down
in Cabo San Lucas.
I make this delivery,
I'm gonna have me
over a million.
Hey, you think I'm gonna let
a little cheese-eatin' nigger
like this fuck that up?
You best think again.
Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head...
and ten niggers
look just like him.
You understand
what I'm saying?
Yeah.
- So we on the same page then?
- Yeah, I follow.
My nigger.
Miss Brown!
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas,
L.A.P.D.
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff.
You know, I'm a flight
attendant for Cabo Air.
- Can I help out here?
- Who's this?
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I. D?
- Yeah. Sure.
Would you mind if we just
took a look in that bag?
Do I mind?
Do I have a choice?
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No.
I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.
If I don't want to go to
all that trouble, I'd just
take you in on suspicion now.
- Suspicion of what?
- Uh, could I say something?
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute.
I'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.
Bad knees.
You have a good flight?
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo.
I went down there one time
with Susan, my wife.
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable.
Hey, can I look
in this envelope?
Ah.
Goddamn.
I'd say there's
about, oh, uh,
$50,000 here.
What would you say, Ray?
Looks like about 50,000
from here.
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?
You should know if you bring in anything
over 10,000,you have to declare it.
You forget, or what?
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie...
I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie.
Those guys down in Customs?
They're a bunch of pricks.
Excuse me, but they are.
There's something about
that job makes those people
really hard to get along with.
You can go down and talk
with those guys...
who are really suspicious
and really disagreeable human beings,
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.
It's up to you.
Let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown.
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law.
In 1985, while
a stewardess for Delta,
you were busted while
carrying drugs for a pilot?
That pilot was my husband,
and I got off.
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it.
He did time, you did probation.
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office.
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not.
So you get off
with a slap on the wrist,
but all this criminal activity
fucks up your shit for good
with the big airlines.
Cut to 13 years later,
you're 44 years of age,
flying for the shittiest little
shuttle-fuckin'piece of shit
Mexican airline there is,
where you make what...
$ 13,000 a year?
I make 16,000,
plus benefits.
You been in the service industry
plus benefits?
Didn't exactly set the world
on fire, did you, Jackie?
Jackie, you have
a good lawyer?
Can she afford
a good one, is more like it.
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks...
before the public defender
gets around to ya.
- Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?
Yeah? No?
Because he knows you.
Well, he knew you.
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning,
shot twice.
Once in the chest,
once in the head.
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.
If you don't know Beaumont,
why do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?
Look, Miss Brown,
we don't give a fuck about you.
You know who we want.
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this.
If you refuse to cooperate,
continue to cop a shit attitude
like you're doing now,
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court.
With your prior, thejudge
will give you two years.
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change,
but if I was
a 44-year-old black woman...
desperately clinging on to this
one shitty, little job I was
fortunate enough to get,
I don't think that I'd think
I had a year to throw away.
So let's start again now,
shall we?
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and
who in America were you bringing it to?
I'm not sayin'
another goddamn word.
I'd like your permission
to look through this again so
we'll know how much we're talking about.
Sure. Go ahead.
While we're at it,
let's see what else is in there.
Do you mind?
Beauty case.
- Mm-hmm. What's in it?
- Beauty products.
Alarm clock.
Glass case.
Birth control.
- What's that?
- My diet shit.
Let's see what else
is in there.
Here. Here. Here.
- What's this?
- What's that shit?
Let's go, ladies.
First door on the left.
#Ninety-nine years
is a long, long, long time #
#Ninety-nine years is such
a long, long, long time #
#Ninety-nine years
is a long, long time #
# Well, look at me #
#I'll never be free #
#I'm a long-time woman ##
Brown, case 70032.
The charge is...
possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.
- How does your client plead?
- Uh, Your Honor,
she wishes to stand mute.
Very well.
Detective... Varga.
- Dargas, Your Honor.
- Sorry.
Uh, you were the arresting officer
in this case?
- That's correct, Your Honor.
- And do you have a bail recommendation?
- Yes, I do, Your Honor.
- And that would be?
Based on the defendant's
prior conviction...
and the extreme possibility of flight
due to the occupation,
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000.
You people are fine with this?
I'm gonna set bond
at 10,000...
and set the date
of August 21...
for the prelim.
Your Honor,
when will that be?
That's six weeks from now.
We'll continue this matter then.
Owens, case 72242.
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon...
and striking an officer.
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25.
Uh, my client
would like to plead guilty, Your Honor.
Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?
Uh-uh-uh. I didn't hear you
wash your hands.
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess.
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.
They set her bond
this afternoon at $10,000.
Now, I'm figuring you could take
that $10,000 you owe me from Beaumont,
move it over
to the stewardess.
- The bond for possession's
only a thousand.
- Hmm. Yeah.
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit "possession with intent".
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces,
they calling that shit "intent".
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession".
Still sounds high.
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses,
let's get Beaumont
out of the way first.
You know, I think
somebody already did.
- What?
- You ain't hear?
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge
blew Beaumont's brains out.
Oh, shit.
That shit rhymes.
Blew Beaumont's
brains out.
Police make contact
with you?
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy,
they start thinking that "where there's
smoke there's fire" logic.
Rousted my ass out of bed
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.
- This stewardess...
You know her last name?
- Mm-hmm.
Brown.
Jackie Brown.
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.
Beaumont worked for you.
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.
Well, we ain't got no, uh...
What you call that shit?
Confidentiality.
Why should I
tell you anything?
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.
I'd say you were in the drug business,
except the money's moving
in the wrong direction.
Whatever you're into, you seem
to be getting away with it,
so, uh, more power to you.
All right.
You want another bond?
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.
That means paperwork.
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court,
make out a receipt for
return of bond collateral,
I type up another application,
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- another indemnity agreement.
- I haven't got time.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.
What you have to do,
in case you forgot,
- is come up with a premium
of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen,
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.
Listen to me, all right?
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused...
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused
of"intent".
If she had that shit...
and mind you, I'm saying if...
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?
Oh, it's like that, huh?
All right.
I got your little
thousand bucks.
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.
Dropping off Lopez, Anita.
Picking up Brown, Jackie.
- Okay, no problem. You armed?
- You bet I am.
Max, here she comes.
# Why do I keep my mind #
# On you all the time #
#And I don't even know you #
#I don't know you #
# Why do I feel this way #
# Thinking about you #
#Every day #
#And I don't even know you #
Miss Brown?
- Yes?
- # Take me in your arms #
- I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman.
- # Thrill me with all #
- # Of your charms #
- I could give you a lift home,
if you like.
- #And I'll take to the sky
on a natural high #
- Okay.
- #Loving you more till the day I die #
- # On a natural high #
- # Take to the sky on a natural high #
- #I want you to be mine #
#Loving you more #
#If you have anything to do #
# Call me and I
will do it for you #
You really
a bail bondsman?
Well, who do you
think I am?
- I showed you my card in there.
- Can I see your I. D?
You're serious?
# That wish would be
for you to live #
#Forever and ever #
Who paid my bond?
- Ordell?
- In cash.
#My heart skips a beat #
- #And I take to the sky

- #I just take to the sky #
- #Loving you more till the day I die #
- # On a natural high #

- #I don't know you #
#Loving you more ##
You got any cigarettes
in here?
You won't find
any cigarettes in there.
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure.
Have you ever been
to the River Bottom?
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar.
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?
- I thought you might
like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there.
How 'bout the Hilton
by the airport?
- Is it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar.
It doesn't sound dark.
Why does it
have to be dark?
Because it looks like I just
got out of jail, that's why.
You're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me.
No, thanks.
I quit three years ago.
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds.
Take it off and put it back on.
That's why I don't quit.
Mm.
If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time trying to find my rent.
You know,
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...
I've been in the business.
I figure about 80% of those
were drug-related, so...
if you want, I could help you
figure out your options.
So far, they told me
if I cooperate,
then I'll get probation,
maybe.
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.
Does that sound right?
I'd say that if they try you
and convict you, you won't get
more than a year and a day.
That's state time,
prison.
But they won't
want to do that.
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...
and a year or two
of probation.
Do you happen to know who
put the dope in your bag?
Yeah.
But that's not
what this is about.
They were waiting
for my ass.
They knew about the money.
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?
Who gave me the money
and who I was givin' it to.
They found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.
They said it was him
who told them about me.
That would be...
Beaumont Livingston.
How do you know
about him?
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Same as you... $10,000.
#Back about 18 and 25 #
#I left Tennessee
very much alive #
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.
- The legal advice and the ride.
- You bet.
- # On a Tennessee stud #
- Good luck. We'll be in touch.

How ya doin',
Miss Jackie?
Come on in.
- Do you got some booze?
- I got some vodka in the freezer.
- Got some O. J?
- Mm-hmm.
Why don't you be
a good hostess...
and hook a brother up
a screwdriver?
Sure.
Well?
- You gonna thank me?
- For what?
Who the hell do you think
got your ass out of jail?
The same guy that put my ass in jail.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, you got caught with blow.
That's your business.
- It wasn't mine.
- What?
Oh, shit.
I bet that was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
Yeah. If you didn't put it in there,
he must have.
Damn. That shit wasn't called for.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Bet they asked you a whole shitload
of questions about it, huh?
And all that money,
where it came from.
Probably asked you who you
was bringin' it to too.
They asked.
And you said?
"I want to talk to my lawyer".
You sure you didn't get nervous
and kind of let somethin' slip?
I mean, if you did,
I ain't mad at you.
I just gotta know.
You ain't asking
the right questions.
You should be asking
why they picked me up.
They were waiting for me.
They knew about the money
and they knew the exact amount.
- They tell you how they happen
to come by this information?
Hmm.
Beaumont Livingston?
I knew it.
I knew it.
They even asked me
if I knew Mr. Walker.
Yeah?
I didn't tell them
anything about him.
My name come up?
Mm-mm.
- You ain't said nothin' about me?
- Mm-mm.
Ah, that's mighty noble
of you.
They tell you what happened
to this Beaumont fellow?
Yeah, they told me.
Yeah.
Somebody must have been
real mad at old Beaumont.
Or else they pretty scared about what
he might say to keep from doing time.
Yeah, I bet they asked you
a whole shitload of questions.
And you ain't givin' them
no kind of answer?
- Mm-mm.
- You scared of me?
You got any reason
to be nervous around me?
Is that what
I think it is?
What do you think it is?
- I think it's a gun
pressed up against my dick.
- Well, you thought right.
Now, take your hands
from around my throat,
nigger.
- What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?
- Shut the fuck up.
Don't you move. Oh, what is this?
What the fuck is this?
Hey, that ain't got nothing to do
with you. I carry that all the time.
You been talking
to them police too much.
- The police didn't try
and strangle my ass.
- Come on, girl.
- I was just playing with you.
- I ain't playing with you.
I'm gonna unload both
of these motherfuckers if you
don't do what I tell you to do.
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Jackie, stop acting crazy.
- Do you understand
what the fuck I'm saying?
- Yeah, woman. Damn!
Now, sit your ass down
on that sofa.
See? Police start fuckin' with your
mind, start pittin' black against black.
- That's how they do.
They been doing this since...
- Shut your raggedy ass up.
Sit the fuck down!
And put your hands behind your head.
- This is gettin' silly now.
- Oh, silly? You want to see
some motherfuckin' silly?
If I have to tell you to shut up
one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.
- I just came over here to talk to you.
- To talk?
The way I see it, you and me got one
motherfucking thing to talk about.
One thing,
and that's what you
are willing to do for me.
- I can get you a lawyer.
- No, let's be realistic.
Now, sooner or later they're gonna
get around to offering me a plea deal,
and you know that.
- That's why you came here to kill me.
- I ain't come over to kill you.
No, that's all right.
It's okay.
Now, I forgive you.
Now, let's say,
if I tell on you,
I walk.
- If I don't, I'll go to jail.
- Uh-huh.
I want $100,000...
in a escrow account
in my name...
if I'm convicted up to a year
or put on probation.
Now, if I have to do
more than a year,
you pay another $100,000.
I can do that.
- You know I got that problem.
All my money is...
- In Mexico.
- Right.
- Well, I been thinking about that too.
I got me an idea.
Uh...
Let me hear that.
We friends again.
Why don't you point that
motherfucking gun somewhere else?
- I'll talk to the cops tomorrow
and tell you if it's on.
- All right.
You want your gun back?
Come in and I'll
get it for you.
Max, look,
I am so sorry about this.
You know,
I was afraid to ask to borrow it,
'cause I was afraid you would say no.
I mean, you'd have to.
Would you like
some coffee?
- If you're having some.
- I am. Come on in.
Why don't you make
yourself at home.
Just, you know,
have a seat.
Did you get a chance
to use it?
I felt a lot safer
having it.
Oh, the milk went bad
while I was in jail.
- Black's fine.
- Cool.
Would you, uh, care to
hang on to it for a while?
It wouldn't be legal, but if it
makes you feel better, I guess...
Well, thanks.
I got one now.
- You went out this morning
and bought a gun?
- What? I didn't hear you.
- You went out this morning
and bought a gun?
Well, let's say
I got one now, okay?
- Somebody loan it to you?
- Yeah.
All right!
We're on.
It might be a little black.
Would you like to hear some music?
Sure.
Cool.
You know, I couldn't wait
to get home last night...
and wash the jail
outta my hair.
- It looks nice.
- Thanks.
You never got into
the whole CD revolution?
Oh, I got a few, but I can't afford
to start all over again.
I mean, I've invested too much
time and money...
in my albums.
Yeah, but you can't get
new stuff on records.
I don't get new stuff
that often.
# I gave my heart
and soul #
#To you, girl #
#Didn't I do it, baby #
- #Didn't I do it, baby #
- It's pretty.
Mm-hmm.
- Who is this?
- The Delfonics.
- #Didn't I do it, baby #
- It's nice.
- Mm-hmm.
- #Didn't I do it, baby #
I called in sick today. As far as
the airline knows, I'm still available.
- Are you?
- I don't know. I'm gonna go in
and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today.
I'm going to do what you suggested...
offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy
that wants you, that'll only
interest him up to a point.
I know, but it's
a lot of money.
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.
- He called?
- He came by.
- What'd you do?
- We talked.
Do you think
he still trusts you?
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass.
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit
over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out.
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used.
I mean, he can't use his other people.
They're crooks.
I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself,
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me.
And I made him feel
like he still can.
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible that
Ordell's killed somebody.
Do you realize that?
Well, I ain't going back to jail and I
ain't doing that probation thing again.
Max, how do you feel
about getting old?
You're not old.
You look great.
No, I'm asking you
how do you feel about getting old.
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It's not really something
I think about.
- Really?
- I guess I got sensitive
about my hair a few years ago.
It started falling out,
so I did something about it.
How'd you feel about that?
I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, I do.
I look in the mirror.
Looks like me.
Yeah, but it's
different for men.
You know, I can't really feel
too sorry for you in this department.
I bet that,
except for possibly an afro,
you look exactly
the way you did at 29.
Well, my ass
ain't the same.
Bigger?
Yeah.
Ain't nothing wrong
with that.
Something else worry you?
Oh.
I always feel like I'm starting over.
- How many bonds you said you wrote?
- 15,000.
- Is that a lot?
- That's plenty.
#Pass them by #
Well, I've flown
over seven million miles,
and I've been waiting
on people for 20 years.
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air,
which is the worst job
you can get in this industry.
You know I make
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn?
And with this arrest hanging over
my head, Max, I'm scared.
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again,
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with.
I'll be stuck
with whatever I can get.
# Oh, baby, please now #
And that shit is
more scary than Ordell.
#La, la, la means #
#I love you ##
- Let's go.
- You don't have to... Ow!
- Hey!
- Hey, great, you're here.
- Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing?
- Fine.
- Can I have a word outside
with Ray for a minute?
- Sure. Take your time.
- I'll just be a minute.
- May I smoke?
Absolutely.
- Dude, what up?
- She wants to make a deal.
- Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?
- She almost sounds scared.
- What's she want?
- She wants to go back to work.
- Oh, yeah?
So what's she going to give us?
- She hasn't gone into specifics.
- She's been waiting for you to get here.
- She knows it's my case, right?
Well, she hasn't said it,
but she's not stupid.
- She knows it's you who wants her.
- Let's go. Cool.
Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.
Now, what can we do for you?
I need permission to leave
the country so I can keep my job.
- Yeah, we can look into that.
- I need it tomorrow.
If I don't show up for
work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Well, you know
what we want.
If I'm working,
I can help you.
Help us do what, Jackie?
- Help you get Ordell Robbie.
- So now, you do know him.
You never asked
if I did or not.
- So you're telling us now
that you do know him.
- Of course I do.
- I deliver money for him.
- No shit?
- You know how he makes his money?
- He sells guns.
- You ever see him sell a gun?
- No.
- Then how do you know he sells guns?
- He told me.
Besides, why else would
a A.T.F. man be after him?
Well, how can
you help us?
I'll do anything I can to help you
get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
And in return for my help,
I need permission to leave the country,
and immunity.
You don't want much,
do you?
Can you do it or not?
You know, I mean...
It's possible.
You're going to hear a guy
beg for his life, lady,
'cause he betrayed
Nani Vitali.
Read the paper.
Read it!
Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.
He's already killed
two people.
- You know what he's known as?
The Mad Dog Murderer.
- Hey, girl.
- iHola!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like
somebody got some new clothes.
Yeah, we did
a little shoppin'.
You know, I couldn't have my boy
running around looking like no bum.
- I don't know. I didn't look like a bum.
- Come on now, man.
- You know you had that
Salvation Army thing going.
Goddamn, girl. You getting high already?
It's just 2:00.
It's that late?
You smoke too much of that shit, that
shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
Not if your ambition
is to get high and watch TV.
- Oh, y'all a couple of
Cheech and Chongs, huh?
Oh, don't get up. I got it.
Have a seat.
Yo. Jackie!
What's up?
No, Jackie,
I didn't get your message.
- I was gonna tell you!
- No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.
- Is she a good lay, huh?
- Here.
- You gotta make sure
ain't nobody following you.
- It's ready to go?
Yeah.
There's another bowl left.
Let me go!
Take your thumb off the carb.
You mean, the sign that's
got the rooster on it?
Shit.
You okay?
I'm just... gettin' old.
I can't... smoke or laugh
now without coughing.
Coughing's good.
It opens up the capillaries.
You know, when you cough, you're
pulling air... or in this case, smoke...
into parts of the lungs that
don't normally get used.
And so, coughing's good.
It gets you higher.
You definitely know
a lot about that.
Look here, Louis, I got
to run out for a little while.
So, since you like
getting high so much,
why don't you hang out here with Mel,
watch a little TV?
- Way ahead of you.
- See, I get high later
on when I come back.
See, I get high at night when I
get through with all my business.
That Rutger Hauer?
No, it's Helmut Berger.
Hmm.
- Why don't you walk me
to the door, space girl?
- Okay.
- You know, I hope you don't mind
hanging out with Louis.
- No problem.
Try not to tear his clothes off of him,
all right? They're new.
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha!
- Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.
- Okay. Later.
Want a Metrix?
Uh... Damn. Shit.
What's a Metrix?
It's like this major meal that you drink
in a shake instead of having a big meal.
- It's like a diet thing?
- No. It's what bodybuilders
drink to, you know, beef up.
No, thanks.
Okay.
When was the last time
I saw you?
Oh... six, seven years ago.
It doesn't seem
like that long ago.
It was that long ago.
- How old were you in this picture?
- Which one?
The roller disco picture.
This one.
Oh. Um, 14.
- You were 14 here?
- Yup.
Shit, man.
I thought you were at least 16.
Well, I'm about the same height
now as I was then.
Bruno! Sanchez!
- That other picture, that green one?
- Yeah?
That was taken at that place
called Flippers.
Do you remember that? It was in
Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then?
- No.
- Where were you?
I was in Detroit.
With Ordell?
Yeah. We had done
some time already.
Oh. Were you a...
disco guy?
Nah.
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.
- Were you ever in one?
- I went to a few just
to meet women, but...
it was so loud
and I didn't like to dance.
During that whole scene,
I just drank in bars usually.
So who didn't make the cut?
- That's a picture of me in Japan.
- Whose arm is that?
Uh, that's the guy
that I lived with.
His name was Hi-Hiro...
Hiro... Hiroshi.
He must have made quite an impression.
If you count cheese.
I never got to know him really.
You know, I couldn't speak anyJapanese,
and his English was terrible.
But what am I going to say? His English
was better than myJapanese, you know.
- That sounds like a problem.
- Not really.
You know, we didn't have that much
to say to each other anyway.
I never really got to know him,
but I knew enough to know...
that I wasn't
missing much, so...
Anyway, I keep that picture because,
of all the fucking time I was there,
that's the only picture
I've got of me in Japan.
- That's Japan.
- Oh. Yeah.
Well... Yeah, I can...
Yeah, it looks... I could tell.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah.
That was fun.
Yeah.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Now we can catch up.
Yeah.
You got a beer?
Yeah, sure.
In the fridge.
# Uh, I mean, damn
Me and you forever hand in hand #
#I'm married to the firm, boo
You got to understand #
#I'll die for 'em, gimme a chair
and then I'll fry for 'em #
- #And if I got to take the stand
I'ma lie for 'em #
- #Lie for 'em #
- #It's me and you hand in hand #
- #Forever #
- #I'm married to the firm, boo
You got to understand #
- # That we be #
#I'll die for 'em, gimme a chair
and then I'll fry for 'em #
- #And if I got to take the stand
I'ma lie for 'em #
- # Uhh, sugar ##
I'm going
to the bar, baby.
# Two people #
- JackieJack!
- Hey.
Damn! I'm gonna have to remember
this place. This is all right.
About two minutes from your crib,
ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.
- What's your drink, brother?
- Let me get a screwdriver, home.
- How're you doing?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Yes, you are.
Damn! I bet you come
in here on a Saturday night,
you need nigger repellant to keep
them motherfuckers off your ass.
- Oh, I do okay.
- Bullshit, Jackie.
You're a fine motherfucker. I bet
you do a damn sight better than okay.
- You think anybody followed you?
- I don't think so.
But it don't matter, 'cause they
already know I'm meeting you.
- How the fuck they know that?
- I told them.
- You told...
- 3.25.
- Here. Keep it.
- Thank you, sir.
- You told 'em it's me?
- They already know it's you.
Goddamn, that don't mean
you got to confirm it.
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly...
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing.
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know... you.
You tell 'em
anything else?
Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico
and you want me to bring it in.
- Goddamn... You told them all that?
- It's true, ain't it?
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?
They know I'm
delivering for you.
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it.
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns.
So I said, "Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?
- Let me bring in the money".
- And they said?
Yes.
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night.
This is just seeming kind of risky now,
you know. Fuck this.
Now, let me lay it all out
to you, okay?
I make two deliveries...
the first with 10,000.
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works.
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
See, that's too much exposure.
- Now, I ain't goin'
nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to.
I told them you never
pick up the money yourself.
- You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.
- Mm.
- That's a good idea.
- If you listen, it's a damn good idea.
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around,
they see me hand
the 10,000 to someone.
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend of yours.
- Like a woman?
- If you want.
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm thinking a woman.
Wait a minute.
If they're gonna let you go,
- how come we don't bring all
the cash in the first time?
- 'Cause I don't trust 'em.
Now, the next trip,
when I bring in the half mils,
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before.
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first.
Hmm.
And they follow the wrong one,
thinking she's bringing
the money to me.
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women.
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got
the women covered.
Where are you planning
on pulling this off?
The Del Amo Mall,
the food court.
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?
It's my plan.
We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money
and I don't need no fuckin' partners.
I ain't your partner.
I'm your manager.
And I'm managing to get your money out
of Mexico, into America, in your hands,
and I'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops.
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 15%.
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent.
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- No. No.
A manager gets 15%,
agent gets 10.
I'm getting 15%,
all right?
All I'm gonna give you
is ten.
And the same deal
as before.
I can do that.
So he says, "Fuck that",
and moves over into guns.
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
He's acting like he's this
big international arms dealer...
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers.
Well, he seems
to be making out.
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.
Yeah, well...
so far, he is.
But you got to admit,
he's not too bright.
Oh... I wouldn't go
so far as to say that.
He moves his lips
when he reads.
What does that
tell you?
Let's say that he's
streetwise, you know.
We'll give him that.
He's still a fuckup.
He killed a man who
worked for him the other day.
Well...
So, what are you trying
to tell me?
That I should get
out of here?
That's not what
I'm saying at all.
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess.
- Does that bother you?
- Please!
Well, I don't know.
You live with him, so...
No, I live here.
He just drops in and out.
Did he tell you about that half million
he's got down in Mexico?
- Uh-huh.
- Of course he did.
He tells anybody who's gonna listen.
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing.
They're scheming on how
they can get that money over here.
And your point is?
- Let him and the stewardess
get the money over here,
- Uh-huh.
and then just
take it from them.
#A man we passed
just tried to stare me down #
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, man.
- You ain't gonna get serious
while we're in here chilling?
- No. It's just about Melanie.
You know what?
I'm real sorry about that, man,
but I had to be somewhere
all of a sudden.
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
So I thought, let him
kick it here with Mel.
# The things that you do #
So, what she say?
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie.
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door.
Melanie real good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way.
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck.
- Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?
Well...
the "not your girlfriend" part
I felt more about.
Oh. Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards.
Afterwards, I did.
Oh, oh, shit.
But, um... But, like,
you know, what is she to you?
You know, she's just one of
the bitches I got set up.
I got Mel
over in Hermosa Beach,
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where you're staying,
and about four blocks away
I got this young 19-year-old
country girl named Sheronda.
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia,
barefoot,
country as a chicken coop.
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood.
- She believed you?
- Hell, yeah.
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood.
Closest she ever been,
anyway.
But you trust Melanie
around your business?
Oh!
She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. See, I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. I know that bitch.
I don't understand why you keep
someone around your business
and you can't even trust 'em.
I ain't gotta trust her.
I know her.
I don't know
what that means, man.
Well, you can't
trust Melanie,
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie.
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around.
I told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl.
You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be...
and she bitch a whole lot more
than she used to,
but she white.
You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.
Hi, Jackie. It's Max.
I was just calling to find out
how everything went today at A.T.F.
If you want to call me,
my home number is...
915-9302.
Or you can reach me
at my office, which is...
313-3688.
It's on the card I gave you
when we first met.
I don't know whether you still have it,
but it's on it.
Oh, let me give you
my beeper number.
It's 991-1075,
then dial 6872.
Wait for a beep,
dial 59...
and hit the pound.
Um, okay, so I'll talk
to you later.
Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.
End of message.
Now, the money's gonna be in
a Del Amo shopping bag, all right?
I get some food, sit down here in
the food court, then your girl comes in.
- Did you find somebody yet?
- Mm-hmm.
- Who?
- What you care?
What I care is my ass
facing the penitentiary.
- You send some hardheaded
rock whore up here and she...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
She ain't gonna be no rock whore.
She's gonna be cool, promise.
- All right, so we straight, right?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna roll up over here and
check out this shirt I was looking at.
- I'll catch you.
- Hey, don't forget your bags.
Shit!
Max! Max!
Hey.
Well, hello.
- Hey, surprise.
- I walked right past you.
I know, ignoring me.
So, what are you up to?
- Just catching a movie.
- What'd you see?
What the fuck
is up with this shit?
- I called you last night.
- I know. I got your message.
Ray wanted to have dinner
with me so we can, you know,
talk about the sting we're plotting.
That's what he calls it,
a sting.
He's been...
He's been real nice.
You think he's got
a thing for you?
Maybe.
But I'm thinking it's something more
like he wants the money for himself.
Has he hinted around?
No. He just tries
to act cool.
You know, I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.
He's just a young guy
having fun being a cop.
I know the type.
Trust me on this.
He's more interested in Ordell
than he is in the money.
If he does anything suspect, it'll be
cutting corners to get the conviction,
but he wouldn't walk off with the money;
it's evidence.
- And what about you, Max?
- What?
If I was
in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you right now,
not if you were somebody else.
If I saw an opportunity to walk away
with a shopping bag full of money,
would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's somebody's life savings.
It wouldn't even be missed.
Half a million dollars
will always be missed.
You're avoiding
the question, Max.
Okay, sure, I guess
I'd be tempted,
especially now since I'm getting out
of the bail bond business.
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.
I guess the main one would be,
uh... I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
It's been
a long time coming,
but I finally
made up my mind.
I guess it was... Thursday.
Miss Brown?
- Yes?
- I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.
The night you got me
out of jail?
Yeah.
I went to pick up this guy.
I hear he's staying
at a house, and, uh...
I sneak in
and I'm waiting for him...
Wait a minute. After we were together,
you snuck into a guy's house?
Yeah. I went back to my office
and found out that you took my gun,
got another gun
and the stun gun,
went to this guy's house in El Monte
and waited for him to come home.
- What do you do when he comes home?
- Shoot him with the stun gun.
While he's incapacitated,
you cuff him and take him to County.
- You do that?
- It's my job.
- Did you do that that night?
- Well, the guy never came home.
But I'm sitting on his couch
in the dark holding my stun gun.
The whole house
smells of cat pee.
And after a couple of hours,
I think,
"What am I doing this?
It's 19 years
of this shit".
And I make up my mind.
That's it.
I'm not sure you answered
my question, Max.
Which one?
If you had the chance,
unemployed now,
to walk away
with a half million dollars,
would you take it?
We gotta stop
meeting like this.
- How was your flight?
- Fine.
- Bet you're happy to be working again.
- Yeah.
This is A.T.F. Agent
Ray Nicolet.
Jackie Brown,
Ordell Robbie.
Money exchange,
trial run.
Time is 3:07,
July 1, 1995.
Location is a parking
structure at LAX,
row "F",
parking structure "D".
- What are you doing?
- Recording all this.
- I thought you were going
to let this one go through.
- We are. Don't worry about it.
Every bit of this
goes in my report.
The subject is carrying
a flight bag.
I am now removing from the flight
bag a manila envelope.
The envelope contains currency.
- All the same denomination?
- Mm-hmm.
One-hundred-dollar bills.
Okay, I'm now
counting it.
- What time do you have to be there?
- 4:30. I'm meeting a woman.
- What's her name?
- He wouldn't say.
- You gonna follow her?
- When she leaves, somebody'll be on her.
- You're not gonna stop her?
- No, not this time.
Okay.
The total amount of cash...
in the manila envelope
is $10,000, right?
- The subject is delivering
the currency in a...
- Oh.
Del Amo Fashion Center bag.
Del Amo Fashion Center bag.
- The bag is, uh... purple...
- It's white.
- Huh? White.
- It's white.
- Fine, the bag's white...
- With pink lettering.
- Purp...
- Image is purple.
- Lettering's pink.
- Fine...
Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple
on it, and the lettering's pink.
- Right.
- And a really good-looking woman
on the cover.
Okay. There you go.
- This seat taken?
- No. Have a seat.
- You're hungry.
- Yes'm.
Put the bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, next to mine.
And then when I leave...
Well, you know.
So, what's your name?
Sheronda.
Sheronda,
that's a nice name.
Sheronda, go ahead.
You can eat.
Well, Sheronda,
it was nice talking to you.
All right. I'll be back.
I'll check the bag. Stay here.
Max, you said it yourself.
Ray wants Ordell.
He doesn't give a shit
about the money.
The money won't convict him.
Guns will.
You're rationalizing.
Well, that's what you do to go
through with the shit you start.
You rationalize.
I can do it, Max.
I know I can.
I just can't do it
without you.
It's cool.
Excuse me, baby.
Uh, do you know what time it is?
- No, ma'am. I ain't got no watch.
- Oh. Hmm.
It could work.
If she handles
the cops right,
it could work.
#I gave my heart
and soul #
# To you, girl #
#Didn't I do it, baby #
#Didn't I do it, baby ##
What?
Jackie Brown.
It ain't like I'm asking you
to go somewhere and spend the night.
I just want you to go out for
a little while while I work this deal.
So now you're
going to pout!
Now it's going to take her 20 minutes
to find her purse, look for her sandals,
find her sunglasses,
get outta here.
Jackie, Louis.
Louis, Jackie.
That chick you saw stomping
around the back there,
that's Melanie
who about to leave!
Have a good time in there, baby.
Don't burn now.
- Want a drink?
- No. I want to talk to you now,
outside. Now.
Mm. Let's step
into my office.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton...
- What's up?
- ...that day, I cut my throat.
You got that we do it the way
I laid out, or we don't do it at all!
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- What the hell I'm talkin' about?
- Sheronda passed the money
on to somebody else.
- How do you know she did that?
- I was there! I saw it!
- You weren't supposed to be there.
- I knew you would try to
pull some shit like that!
- Hold on!
- I ain't pulling no shit!
- What do you call it, then?
It's my goddamn money! I can do
what the fuck I wanna do with it.
With my ass on the line,
oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
- lf we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!
- Now chill! Chill!
- Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No!
Listen! Listen!
The woman you saw was my friend Simone.
She's the one gonna be
receiving the money.
I think she oughta see how the shit
go down. She's a nice woman.
You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's
on her way over here right now. Hold on.
Louis, call Simone.
Tell her to get her ass over here.
We waiting on her.
- Damn!
That what you're pissed off about?
- Oh, just a little pissed?
Mm, mm, mm. I'm sorry.
I'm about ready for a refill.
Are you sure I can't tempt you
a little bit more?
- Come on.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.
You better give me
something strong.
Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop
me at the airport and mark your bills.
I don't like that part.
It washes off!
I tell 'em we do the same thing
as before, and they'll follow Sheronda.
Yo, Louis. Louis?
She ain't there?
- Yo! No answer?
- Hmm?
Now, you gotta listen to this, man,
'cause this concerns you, all right?
- Lou!
- Hmm?
Okay, now, this time you're going to
get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?
Right.
The same one Simone gives me, okay?
Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Billingsley. She knows what I look like?
She's seen you
with Sheronda, remember?
All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you
in the dress department, right?
- Right. Designer clothes.
- Right, right, right, right.
The place y'all try shit on.
It's a fitting room. Big sign
over the door. You can't miss it.
Uh...
Why over there?
Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard.
That's why we can't take the risk
in doing it out in the open...
or even in
the dining area.
That's why we got to do it
in the fitting room with a woman.
Okay.
Now, you're going to take...
the Billingsley bag Simone gives you
and give it to Sheronda.
- Right.
- And Simone gon' to wait.
Then she's going to peep out
the dressing room, wait on you...
to give her the sign
there ain't nobody watching.
She's going to leave the store,
get in the car, mission accomplished.
Hey! See?
So, what are you going
to be doing during all this?
Now that you got 'em watching my ass,
I'm gonna be in a titty bar
waiting on Louis...
to call me and tell me
everything's cool.
I got to go! Hey!
- Damn!
Who's wantin' to page you like that?
- It's Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That shit work my nerves, you and that
motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.
Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with
that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.
Ordell has a guy
working for him named Louis.
- You two meet?
- Yeah, this afternoon
before I came here.
He was at Ordell's apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah.
I don't know if he lives there,
but I can find out.
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really. Mm-mm.
His full name's Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville.
- For what?
- Bank robbery.
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell.
They did two years together about,
I don't know,
over at Huntsville.
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though.
Ordell's got him staying
down in Compton.
living with some 56-year-old
petty thief, some woman named, uh...
Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.
Hmm.
- You know her?
- No.
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet.
Okay, who's the other one?
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's.
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke I got busted with.
- Oh, yeah?
- She knows everything.
She's not a part of it,
and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it.
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet.
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?
Everything's the same,
except for one change.
- I told him Ordell's changing
the amount he's bringing in.
- Think they bought it?
Mm, oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking
that Ordell's real nervous,
and they love thinking
that he's scared of'em.
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit.
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation.
Everything's the same,
except for one change.
What's that?
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money,
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid.
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil
where it is,
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail.
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
You still have to show him
the money at the airport.
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.
He'll see 50,000.
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath.
- What ifhe checks?
- He won't. He didn't before.
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top.
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really.
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr. Walker put it in there...
and I didn't know anything about it,
like the coke.
- Well, then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail...
and at least I tried.
You're going to have
surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out of that fitting room.
- Wearing a dress.
- Well, a suit.
There's this one I had my eye on.
You know, it's like...
Excuse me.
Hello?
Look here, we got
a little change in plans.
No, no, no, no,
it ain't no thing.
Everything's the same,
except one little difference.
You know that bitch Simone
you saw in the mall?
Well, she wasn't here today
'cause she done split on my ass.
Yeah. Me and Louis went by her pad.
She gone.
She gone, her shit's gone and my
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't start buggin' on me.
Goddamn it, I'm telling you,
ain't nothing different.
Everything's just like
we discussed.
Now, except for this time
when we make the split,
instead of Simone
it's gonna be Melanie.
I think someone's knocking
on the door.
Goddamn it, Melanie gotjust
as much sense as that bitch has,
she'd be in the same place.
All right.
Yeah, later.
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.
I hope he's a good sailor.
Chicken shit.
Okay, the envelope contains $50,000.
I've counted it,
and I'm now marking the bills...
in the upper left-hand corner in the
second zero with a green felt-tip pen.
Ever been tempted?
What?
Put one of these in my pocket?
Mm-hmm.
If I did, I'd have to give
one to you, wouldn't I?
Of course, nobody knows
how much there is.
I guess we could take as much
as we want. Isn't that right?
Yes.
All those things are true.
I mean, it's not like
the money belongs to anybody.
- That would be one point of view.
- Yeah.
Except it's not a point of view
shared by the A.T.F.
Once we make this evidence,
it belongs to us.
You're officially out of trouble now.
Don't go doing
something stupid.
How can I do anything stupid
when I'm being watched every second?
You know,
I'm glad you pointed that out,
'cause it saves me the trouble
of pointing it out to you.
Now, look.
Here's the deal.
I want you to take
all this cash.
I want you to put it in this
Billingsley shopping bag.
And that is exactly
what I expect to see...
when I look inside Sheronda's
Billingsley shopping bag.
Comprende?
- Si, comprende.
- Cool.
Hey, there's only three reasons
you couldn't make your court appearance.
One, you in a hospital,: two,
you in jail,: three, you ass is dead.
- That means you're not my friend, man.
Why're you putting...
- Winston!
- Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
- I'm gonna be gone a few hours.
- Where you going?
- Del Amo Mall. Catch a movie,
maybe somethin' to eat.
- What you gonna see?
- Something that starts soon
and looks good.
Cool. Have fun.
- Let's go!
- In a minute!
You said that before.
Let's go!
#Found out she couldn't fly #
#It was too late #
#And if it's too late
and she's gone too far #
- Hello?
- Louis? What the fuck
you still doing there, man?
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting on her.
I'm ready to go, yeah.
You're the one
in motherfucking charge!
She keeps saying,
"In a minute", right?
Go in there, grab that bitch by the
hair, drag her fuckin' ass outta there!
That's my goddamn
money we...
#She didn't know
what she was headed for #
#And when I found
what she was headed for #
- Hey, we gotta go! We're late!
- #But it was too late ##
- Come on, Mel! We gotta go! Let's go!
- Kiss my ass, fuck wad!

- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.
Um, I think I like that suit.
I'd like to try it on.
Wow!
You look really cool.
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great.
I mean, you wear that suit
to a business meeting,
and you'll be the badass in the room.
Yeah? I think I like it.
I'll take it.
- I'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?
Cash.

Hey, girl, what's up?
- Hey, are you getting that suit?
- Yeah. You like it?
- It looks really good on you.
- You got something for me?
You betcha.
I put a cherry on top.
Booh-yah!
What the fuck did Ordell
ever do for us, huh?
Thanks.
I decided to wear this suit
instead of my tired old uniform.
- Oh, that's no problem.
- So, how much is it?
Okay, there's a blouse,
pants.
Comes to $267.
Okay.
- Wait! Your change.
- Oh.
Uh, by the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.
Ray, Ray, Ray, come out
wherever you are! Ray!
Ray, come out! Ray, Melanie,
she burst into the dressing room.
She took all the money
and ran out!
Aw, fuck.
Come on. Goddamn, we're late.
Come on.
- Come on.
- What the fuck?
We should've been there already,
and we would've if it hadn't been
for your fuckin' around.
Jesus Christ,
Louis, maintain.
- Jesus. Ow!
- Just... I'm telling you, cut the shit.
Ow.
Idiot.
- Just let go.
- Straighten up, bitch.
- You fuckin' mongoloid.
- Fuckin'...
Oh, now, look at this. This is nice...
I think I like it.
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.
- Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?
Cash.
It's a nice outfit on her.
I'm gonna go over and look
at this Michi Moon display.
You just stay right fuckin' here,
all right? Just stay right here.
Are you sweating?
Job a little too much
for you?
I'm gonna be
over there.
- You just stay right here.
- 'Cause you're a little
bit too conspicuous.
I don't care how conspicuous,
you fuckin' stay here.
Hey, would you let go!
Designer Clothes.
Fuck it.
Look, where you goin'?
- Getting out of here. What do you think?
- Let me have the bag.
- Fuck you. I can carry it.
- Goddamn, give me the bag.
- Fuck you...
- What, you're gonna rip the fuckin' bag?
Give me that bag
before I knock you the fuck up.
- Take your fuckin' hands off.
- Okay, okay.
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
- I'm carryin' the bag.
- All right, you got it.
Take a chill pill, for chrissake.
Fuck you
and your chill pill.
'Member where we came in?
No, that's towards Sears.
Where the f...
Which way? Which way?
Jesus, but if you two aren't
the biggest pair of fuckups...
I've ever met
in my entire life.
How did you ever rob
a bank?
Hey, when you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?
No wonder you went
to jail.
Is it this aisle, Louis?
Is it?
Louis?
Lou-isss?
Is it this aisle,
or is it the next one over?
- It's this one.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You positive?
You don't seem sure to me.
Hey, don't say...
Don't say anything else, okay?
Keep your mouth shut.
- Well...
- I mean it.
Don't say one fuckin' word, okay?
Okay, Louis.
See, just where
I said it was.
God.
#In my midnight confession #

Can I show you something?
Not right now. I'm just killin' time,

Oh, sure thing. Well,
if anything grabs you, don't be shy.
I won't. Thanks.
- Wow, you look really cool.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great. I mean, you wear that...
- Straighten up, bitch.
- You fuckin'mongoloid.
- Now, look at this.
- I think I like it.
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?

- Cash.
Hey, would you let go!
Designer Clothes.
I decided to wear the suit
instead of my tired old uniform.
- Oh, that's no problem. I understand.
- How much is it?
- Okay, blouse, pants.
- And away we go.
Comes to $267.
- Here you go.
- Wait! Your change!
By the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.
Excuse me.
My wife thinks she left a bag
ofbeach towels in the fitting room.
Yeah, I think they're there. Go get 'em.
There's nobody in there.
- Thanks.
- Last stall.
Got it.
I wasn't even gonna buy anything.
#...do it, baby #
#I tried so many times
and that's no lie #
#It seems to make you laugh
each time I cry ##
All right. Just keep drivin' to Ninth,
where all them car dealerships is.
We gonna leave this heap
in the parking lot and pick up...
a car the cops don't know
nothin' about.
Where's Melanie?
Well, that's what I wanna tell you. You
see, she was buggin' me the whole time.
She got pissy with me 'cause
I wouldn't let her carry the bag.
And then she started runnin' her
fuckin' mouth about, you know, like...
'cause I couldn't remember where the car
was parked right away when we came out.
So then she got on me about that.
"Is it this aisle, Louis?
Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was
totally fuckin' with my nerves, man.
- So, what? You left her there?
- l-I shot her.
You shot Melanie?
- Twice. In the parking lot.
- You couldn't talk to her?
- Well, how can you talk to her?
You know how she is.
- You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe, but at that time...
moment, I don't know, l...
You shot her?
Twice?
- Is she dead?
- I-I... Pretty much.
What do you mean "pretty much", Louis?
That ain't no fuckin' answer.
- Yes or no. Is she dead?
- l-I think so.
- You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she...
- She's dead. She's dead.
- Well, where'd you shoot her?
- In the chest and the stomach.
If you had to do it,
then you had to do it, brother.
What we don't want
is that bitch survivin' on us.
Anybody but that woman.
Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
- How much is there?
- I don't know. Maybe 40.
Shit, maybe less.
Well, you...
you said 550.
Yeah, so you light, ain't you?
You light about half a million, ten.
Look, look, man.
That's the bag she came out with.
- She never put her hand in it.
Neither did I.
- Came out of where?
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.
- How long was she in there?
- A minute. Not even a minute.
She came right out.
- Louis, you tellin' me the truth?
- Listen, I swear to God, man.
I swear on my life.
She came out with that fuckin' bag,
and I took it from her.
- And then what?
- And that was it.
We went to the parking lot.
- Where you shot her?
- That's right.
Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room
somewhere with a half million dollars...
I worked my ass off to get
waitin' for you?
- Oh, fuck you for asking me that.
- Hey, I know the bitch
tried to set me up.
- Fuck you, brother.
How could you fuckin' ask me that?
- She didn't ask you?
Shit!
Pull the car
over a minute.
Why'd you ask me that?
- All right, so where's
the gun you shot her with?
It's in there.
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?
I could've taken two out already.
It's Jackie Brown.
Well, you know, if she got to it,
why didn't she take it all?
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch
before I blow her brains out.
Well, maybe the Feds
got it.
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
See, if there wasn't nothin'
in that bag but them towels,
then maybe she didn't get
a chance to take the money...
out of her suitcase
and the A.T.F. got it.
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass.
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right.
That's right.
And then she puts 40 grand or so
in there to rub that shit in my face.
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Ah. I don... I don... You know,
I don't know. I don't know.
Unless, you know, either she's
got it or the Feds got it.
Or... Or...
Now, check this out.
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first...
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room.
Uh-huh.
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?
- Do you know who I saw
in the dress department?
- No, tell me.
I didn't think anything of it.
I... No, no, I did wonder
what he was doin' there.
I wondered what he was doin' there, but
I thought it had nothin' to do with us.
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. It's a big place...
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?
- Yeah, Max Cherry.
- Max Che...
You seen Max Cherry
in the dress department where we...
Man, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you!
You see that motherfucker
in the dress department when we
about to get a half million dollars.
- And you don't think nothin'
about him bein' there?
- No. Do they know each other?
Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County.
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- You know your bail bondsmen.
You know all them motherfuckers
is crooked as a barrel of snakes,
don't you?
Why should I think something's weird
if I don't know nothin' about them
knowin' each other?
- I don't wanna hear
no fuckin'excuses, Louis.
- I ain't givin' you excuses.
But I'm tellin' you... I don't fuckin'...
I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.
Oh, you gonna tell me
the reason...
you lost every goddamned cent
I got in the world?
- Hey... Hey, man.
- You gonna tell me reasons?
- You better...
- Let me tell you the reason,
motherfucker.
The reason is your ass
ain't worth a shit no more.
You better fuckin'
back off, man.
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Her ass used
to be beautiful.
You didn't tell me
you were goin' shoppin'.
- I thought I did.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.
You know,
if it's me...
and I got all that shit hangin' over
my head like you got hangin' over yours,
I don't know,
I'd go shoppin' later.
Well, I got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...
that I've wanted, and, well,
I'm just gonna go try it on...
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait a minute.
Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?
Let me finish.
I got there early. The idea was to
try on the suit, see if I liked it.
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and I would put back on my uniform...
'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it.
Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag
with the $50,000 and go home.
Yeah, but you didn't do that.
Because I couldn't.
Ray, I swear.
Melanie burst in.
She grabbed the bag.
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it.
What happened
to the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan.
Ordell probably told her
to do it.
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off.
But I couldn't go after her,
because I was in my fucking underwear.
And I had to put on this suit because I
could put it on faster than my uniform...
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- I had to. Ray, I was frantic.
What was I supposed
to do?
All right,
what you do after that?
I went lookin' for you. And I went
back to the place in the mall...
where you were before,
but you weren't there.
What was I supposed to do
if something happens?
You didn't tell me how to do that.
There was a guy
with Melanie?
There was nobody
in the fitting room.
Okay.
You've no idea what happened
to the $50,000.
- You're clueless, right?
You've no idea where the 50 grand is?
- I have no idea.
- None.
- You have no idea... It could've
gone here, could've gone there?
I know nothin'. Not a clue.
I don't have an idea where
the motherfuckin' money is.
- Not even a little idea. A maybe.
- Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.
- You'd take a polygraph?
- Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin'
make you happy!
Yeah, put it right there.
I'll do it.
Man.
I sure hope you didn't do
anything stupid, Jackie.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Fuck.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
shot in the car on Ninth.
And we lost Ordell.
I thought you were
fuckin' watchin' him.
We were,
and we lost him.
He walked into a strip bar sometime
around 3:30 and never came out.
The bar was on Ninth, what,
less than a mile and a half
from where they found Louis.
It looks like Louis' buddy
shot him twice, point-blank range.
- So what's gonna happen now?
- We pick up Ordell.
We got three murders we can link him to,
and we got you.
What about me?
What about you?
You think I took
some of that money?
Hey, I have no evidence
of you doin' anything.
You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit
with marked bills.
I'm glad to see that.
You've been helpin' us out.
You gave us Melanie.
You gave us Louis.
Melanie was found with a packet
of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.
That goes a long way
in backing up your story.
I'll settle for Ordell
with marked bills.
But if there's
anything else...
you haven't told me about, you know
what, that's between you and Ordell.
I just got one thing
to say.
You better hope we find him
before he finds you.
No, no, no, I done told you,
I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr. Walker.
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway
till I get my motherfuckin' money.
Come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein' who
my friends are, motherfucker, right...
Hello? Hello?
Motherfucker hung up on me.
You believe that shit?
Ingrate nigger.
See, you bring a motherfucker up,
next thing you know they breaking
you off some goddamned disrespect.
Motherfuck!
Shit!
Goddamn, girl.
How you live like this?
- Like what?
- Like this.
This some repugnant shit.
Bail bonds.
- Yeah, Max there?
- He ain't here right now, man.
- Well, where he at? Out of town?
- He's around, man.
- Well, give me his home number.
- No, I'll give you his beeper number!
All right.
Break out the beeper number, nigger.
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you.
- Do you know who this is?
- This is Mr. Robbie, isn't it?
I have your 10,000.
That's why you called.
The bond collateral that you put down
on Beaumont Livingston...
and moved over
to Miss Brown, remember?
Oh, she got off,
did she?
They decided to no-file
this morning.
Tell me where you are.
I'll come give you your money.
You still there?
Look here, man.
I know you helped her.
And I know you know
what I want.
And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head,
as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money.
Now, she wanna be my friend,
she do that.
She don't want to be
my friend no more,
well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont.
And if she go to the police,
you tell her I will name her ass
as my accessory.
And we'll go upstate,
hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.
And that's a promise.
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
You tell her that,
and I'll call you back.
You're right.
It was Ordell.
If you have time, do you think you could
find out where he's stayin' for me?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
- They don't have
your winning personality.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, just as long as you know.
I think I do.
Good enough?
You bet.
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on
the door like the goddamned police?
- You lookin' to get shot?
- I thought you might be asleep.
You keep fuckin' with me,
you the one gonna be asleep... forever.
I'm alone.
Get your ass
in the house.
No, freeze, motherfucker.
What you doin'?
Got your money...
your bond refund?
This all?
- I have a receipt for you to sign.
- No, no, no, motherfucker.
You know what I mean.
You talked to her?
She wants to give you
your money.
If she didn't, there'd be cops
batter-ramming your door down right now.
- How'd you find me, anyway?
- Winston found you.
- How'd he find me?
- That's what he does.
He finds people
that don't wanna be found.
Oh, well,
bully for that nigger.
So, she wanna give me
my money, huh?
Yeah. She wants to give it
to you herself, and she wants
to collect her ten percent.
She also wants to explain
why she had to hang on to it.
Oh, and I wanna hear
that shit too.
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.
Why don't you
tell me why?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie.
She'd already tried to getJackie
to go in with her,
split the half million
amongst themselves.
What she did was take quite a risk
to make sure you got your money.
And you helped her,
didn't you?
All I did was walk out
with it.
Y'all went to all that trouble
just to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
My ass may be dumb,
but I ain't no dumb ass.
Go over there and sit
on that couch.
Don't worry about her.
She don't even know you're here.
Sit down.
Place stinks.
You get used to it.
- Where my money at?
- My office.
- WhereJackie at?
- She's been there since Thursday night.
If she want to talk to me,
how come she wasn't home?
- She's afraid.
- Oh, right. That I gotta see.
She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened.
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe; she can't.
Call her and give her
the combination.
Look, I'm tellin'you,
you got her spooked.
She won't leave there till you
get your money and you're gone.
Oh, you expect me
to just go walkin' in there?
If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now.
When you told her that
you'd name her as an accessory,
that scared her more than anything.
- She believed you.
- Mmm.
Then that's why she wanted
to give me my money, ain't it?
It ain't got nothin' to do
with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?
See, I ain't trust Melanie,
either, but I could handle her.
That was my little
blonde-haired surfer girl.
And I told that fuckin' Louis all he
had to do was hit her in the mouth.
But no,
he had to shoot her.
- Jackie's at your office, huh?
- Uh-huh.
She by herself? That big-ass nigger
Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
All right.
I call over there,
she better answer the phone.
She will.
I'll be here.
See you in a bit.
Goddamn. In all the time I've known her,
I ain't never heard her
scared like that.
Usually, she too cool
for school.
Hold up, home.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.
I didn't know
you liked the Delfonics.
They're pretty good.
#I gave my heart and soul
to you, girl #
#But this time
I'm really leavin'you, girl #
# Oh, oh
Hope you know it, baby #
#Hope you know it, baby #
#Didn't I do it, baby #
#Didn't I blow your mind
this time #
#Didn't I, ohh #
#Didn't I blow your mind
this time #
#Didn't I
I got to leave you, baby #
My money's in
that office, right?
If she start giving me some
bullshit about it ain't there...
and we gotta go
someplace else and get it,
I'm gonna shoot you in the head
right then and there.
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch
in the kneecaps, find out
where my goddamn money is.
She gonna tell me too.
Hey, look at me when I'm
talkin' to you, motherfucker.
Listen.
I go walkin' in there and that nigger
Winston or anybody else is in there,
you the first motherfucker gets shot,
you understand me?
Yeah.
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me
before we get out of this car, is there?
- No.
- Last chance, motherfucker. You sure?
You better be, motherfucker.
All right.
Let's roll.
You got the key, right?
All right, now, when we get up in here,
you go up in here slow, all right?
I want you to keep your ass
in front of me.
Don't be fuckin' around
herky-jerky or nothin'.
Why it so dark in here?
Say, Jackie.
That you?
Yeah.
Goddamn, girl.
What you doin' sittin' off
in here in the dark?
Ray, he's got a gun!
He dead?
Yeah, he's dead.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
He oughta have 40,000
in his pocket there...
and maybe another 10,000
I gave him.
Why'd you give him $ 10,000?
Returned a bond collateral.
Brought it to him so he
wouldn't have to come here.
Well, how'd you know
where he was?
I found him.
- What do you mean you found him?
- That's my job.
- You guys didn't tell the police?
- I told Jackie.
She said you wanted him.
Ray?
Remember when you said you hoped
you'd get him before he gets me?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you did.
Thanks.
Knock, knock.
Hey.
Hey, you.
I got your package.
It was fun gettin'
a half million dollars in the mail.
- Less ten percent.
- Why'd you take so little?
- That's my fee.
- This isn't a bail bond, Max.
- l-I hesitated takin' that much.
- Well, you earned it.
Well, I'm leavin' now, and, you know,
I'm all packed up, ready to go...
- That's Ordell's.
- They confiscated everything else.
Registration was
in the glove box.
Keys were underneath the seat.
Hey.
What's the matter? Haven't you
ever borrowed somebody's car before?
Not after they're dead.
I didn't use you, Max.
I didn't say you did.
And I never lied to you.
- I know that.
- We're partners.
I'm 56 years old.
I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Do you blame yourself
for helpin' me?
No.
Look, I'd really feel a whole lot better
if you took some more money.
You'll get over that.
Where you goin'?
- Spain.
- Madrid or Barcelona?
Mmm, Madrid first.
Have you been there?
- I hear they don't eat dinner
until midnight.
- You wanna go?
Thanks, but, uh,
you have a good time.
You sure
I can't twist your arm?
Thanks for sayin' that,
but no.
Are you scared of me?
A little bit.
I'll send you a postcard.
Will you?
I sure will, partner.
You're running a business, Max.
Cherry Bail Bond.
Uh, what is it
your son's charged with?
Yes, that's
a very serious offense.
Is your son still in school?
Does his father still live
in the house?
Could I excuse myself? Would you
call me back in about half an hour?
Yes, thank you.
